## PROBLEM
Many things are going wrong in our nation. Will the United States survive with a government of, by, and for the people, and equality before the law? If we keep doing what we’re doing, we’re not going to make it.

Most of us want lives that have meaning and use our gifts. We want a role in the decision-making of our communities. We want a level-playing field that encourages innovation, productivity, and prosperity. We want our taxes to promote the general welfare. Under our current monetary system, achieving these goals is impossible. We currently value profits over life, and our system demands exponential, continuous, cancer-like economic growth.

## SOLUTION
We make a simple change to our money system---with an overnight accounting entry. This change will take education, discussion, preparation, and courage. It will be profound. This alternative money system will level the economic playing field, encourage innovation and productivity, and establish a genuinely free and responsible marketplace---one that offers a balance of freedom and responsibility to both consumers and producers. We can protect the environment, embrace sustainability and a business ethic that makes our quality of living the highest priority.

A new money system will support a government of, by, and for the people, and increase participation and better decision-making.

We will have less debt, and prices can drop. We can pay less in taxes and get more for our money. Everyone can have health care and education, and some can still become very rich.

We can do all of this with a change in the money system. There is a practical path to better future. Here is the path…
