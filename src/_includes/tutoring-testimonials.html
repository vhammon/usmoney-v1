<blockquote class="indent">&ldquo;Christopher is by far the best tutor I have ever had. He has a way of teaching that never bores me, stays at my level, and is so interactive that you can’t just space out and not retain the information. Because of him teaching me Adobe InDesign, I look like a rockstar at work. He helps me to put little details and technical knowledge into the bigger picture. He also finds great online tools and resources for me to use. Christopher is flexible with your schedule and is incredibly easy to work with.&rdquo; &ndash; Kim

<blockquote class="indent">&ldquo;Christopher started tutoring me when I was completely lost in my college InDesign class; he completely saved me from failing the course or from having to drop out. His instructions and advice were beyond exceptional. He is unbelievably knowledgeable in Adobe InDesign, as well as Adobe Illustrator. Christopher has an exceptionally creative eye for design as well as the technical skills and knowledge to help anyone who wants to learn InDesign. His tutoring was stellar – especially compared to the required class textbook that I had to use for my InDesign class. He laid out the program in a simple and concise way. I highly recommend Christopher for anyone interested in learning InDesign.&rdquo; &ndash; Kristen</blockquote>
