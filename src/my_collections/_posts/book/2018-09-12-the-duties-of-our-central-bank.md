The Fed’s duties fall into 4 distinguishable areas:

1. Basic banking services;
2. Banking standards & supervision;
3. Money creation; and,
4. Compensating for an unstable system.

## Basic banking functions

### Services to financial institutions & the public

_Providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. Government, and
foreign official institutions, including playing a major role in operating the nation’s payments system (Fed 2005)._

These are the same banking services explained in [Chapter 3.25](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-3/section-25)–[3.26](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-3/section-26) — secure storage, transfer, accounting, plus the financial service of brokering loans between the banks.

## Bank regulations and supervision

### Supervision & regulation

_Supervising and regulating banking institutions to ensure the safety and soundness
of the nation’s banking and financial system and to protect the credit rights of
consumers (Fed 2005)._

The central Fed shares this responsibility with State banking oversight
and with other government agencies.

## Money creation

_MONETARY & ECONOMIC POLICY. Conducting the nation’s monetary policy
by influencing the monetary and credit conditions in the economy in pursuit of
maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates
(Fed 2005)._

The creation of money is by far the most important privilege and
power accorded to the Federal Reserve System. But, I have not found
a clear and honest statement of the money creation role in accessible
Fed documents intended for public consumption. Curiously, this
seems to be a blind spot for central bankers. In the past two years
Great Britain and Germany, after some central bankers insisted
on the record that they did not create money, commonwealth
money advocates pushed their parliaments to order their central
banks to research and produce a report on money creation. The
central bankers in their reports, said, Oh, my, we DO create money.
Who knew?<sup>20</sup>

The central Fed creates new money when it issues a loan to a member
bank or to the US government, just like your bank creates money
for you when it issues you a loan. However, as the Fed itself makes
clear, the individual banks exercise the greatest power to increase
or decrease the money supply. The role of the central Fed is one of
influence, not control over how much money the private banks create.
That is an astounding free ticket to the private banking sector.

## Fed influence on the money supply

In theory, the central Fed has some influence on how much money
the private bankers create; but, in practice, it does not. The central
Fed cites three primary tools for influencing the creation of new
money by its member banks:

1. Setting a target for the interest banks charge each other for
   loans, called the _Federal funds rate;_ an
2. Setting the rate it charges when it makes loans – creates
   money – for its members, called the _discount rate;_
3. Buying and selling securities through its _Open Market_
   _Operations._

### Set a target Federal Funds Rate

The Federal funds rate is the average interest rate banks charge when
they loan money overnight to each other. It would be more accurate
and helpful to call this the _interbank lending rate._ Remember one of
the primary functions of a central bank is smoothing out the need for
reserves in a fractional reserve money creation system. An individual
bank will aim to keep as little reserve as possible to increase its profits,
but stay within the bounds of the daily demands of its depositors for
access to their money. That’s difficult. A small error could leave them
short, and a little short could spiral an independent bank into a run
and collapse. The central bank allows one bank to borrow the reserves
not used by another bank to cover little daily misjudgments. This
provides more stability for the banks, reduces their need to keep the
prudent reserves on hand they would otherwise need, and increases
their profits.

The Federal Reserve Board sets a _target_ interest rate for this interbank
loan program, and facilitates interbank negotiations on the interest
rate for their transactions. The central Fed then compares the actual
rate to its target as one gauge of how well the money system is
working. If the average interest charged is too far off the target, the
central Fed will conclude there is too much or too little money in the
economy and they will buy or sell securities (mostly US Government
IOUs) to the public to increase or decrease the supply of money.

### Set the Discount Rate

When there are not enough reserves for interbank lending, the
Federal Reserve itself plays fractional reserve money creator and loans
directly to member banks. The interest on these loans is called the
_discount rate._ It would be more accurate and helpful to call this the

_Fed lending rate._ The setting of this interest rate is considered one of
the central bank’s primary tools of monetary policy. The assumption
is the more it costs bankers to borrow these reserves, the more likely
they will be to keep their own reserves on hand, diminishing the
amount of new money they create by lending.

The Fed admits it doesn’t really work this way; they produce the
reserves after the banks have created the money. The _money-multiplier_
reserve story is that the reserves of member banks and the reserves
created by the central Fed when it loans its members money are
the base money of the pyramid [(Chapter 4.34).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-4/section-34) Some bankers and
economists consider this central Fed-created money a special kind of
money, even though it functions like any other, describing it as _base
money,_ or _narrow money,_ or _high-powered money._ These special names
are a map-making conventions, not the reality.

### Buy and sell US Government securities in the Open Market

A group of members from the Fed’s central board and representatives
from the 12 Federal Reserve Banks form the Open Market
Committee. This Committee is in charge of trading US securities
(IOUs from the US Government). At their instruction, the NY
Fed acts as the primary dealer, broker and market maker for US
Government securities – buying them from, and selling them to
the general public. It contracts out some of this brokerage to a few
privileged member banks.

When the Government needs more money, it gives an IOU to the Fed
and the Fed creates new money for our Government, upon which
taxpayers pay interest. The Fed then either sells the US IOU to the
general public or keeps it on its books as an asset. Please note: the
Government is NOT creating this new money; it is borrowing – and
it will pay interest on these loans to the Fed or to whoever comes into
possession of the IOU.

Dealing in US Government debt is considered the primary Fed tool
for changing the amount of money in the economy. In order to
sustain this influence, the amount of available government debt must
increase as the money supply increases.
If the Fed decides there is too much money in the economy and they
want to decrease the supply, they sell some of the US Government
IOUs they hold as assets. When they sell these to the public, they pull
money (Fed IOUs) out of the economy, reducing the money supply.

If the Fed decides there is not enough money in the economy and
they want to increase the supply, they buy a US Government IOU
being held by someone in the public. The IOU goes onto the Fed’s
books as an asset, and in exchange, they issue new money to the seller
(Federal Reserve IOUs-notes). This puts new money into the economy,
increasing the supply.

The Fed uses complicated algorithms to determine at what price
the US Government bonds should be bought or sold and hopes the
market will go along. The rate they choose has some impact on the
entire financial sector because US Government debt is the anchor
for the creation of money by the banking sector. However, the banks
have gamed this requirement such that the impact is diminishing to
negligible.

## Compensating for choosing an unstable system

_FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY. Maintaining the stability of the financial system
and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets (Fed; added
in last 30 years)._

We have chosen an unstable system of money creation and tied it to
the business of finance. This makes our financial markets as unstable
as the money system. In recognition of this instability, laws have
been added to make the Fed responsible for _“containing systemic risks
that may arise in financial markets.”_ This makes the financial markets
unique – they are not dependent on good business practices, nor
on market forces for their survival; the big players in the financial
markets have a government guarantee, granted by virtue of their
tangled connection to their role as creators of the national currency.

_PROMOTING CONSUMER PROTECTION, FAIR LENDING, & COMMUNITY
DEVELOPMENT (added in past 30 years)_

Our chosen system is grossly unfair; it gives privilege and power to
the financial sector. As counterbalance to this extraordinary privilege
and fundamental imbalance of power, over the years Congress added
some requirements that banks issue a percentage of loans in their
own communities. Banks must make room in their portfolio for
some loans to Main Street business. And a law requires banks make a
tiny percentage of loans to people who are financially disadvantaged.
The biggest national banks flick these requirements off their shoulders
as a nuisance; smaller regional banks have to scramble to meet
and document their compliance, which makes it harder for them
to compete.

And, in recognition of the financial sector’s record of treating the
gullible as if they were piggy banks, a few laws were recently added
to give consumers a smidgen of protection from predators in the
financial sector. For example, in 2010 Congress passed and President
Obama signed the _Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act,_ which created the _Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau,_ consolidating Federal consumer financial protection authority
in one place.

This bureau takes action against predatory financial companies
and practices that violate the law. By the end of the Obama
administration, it had returned $12 billion dollars to consumer
victims of fraud.<sup>21</sup>

But, as if the financial sector is incapable of being held to a standard
of integrity and honesty, the money power and its minions in
Congress are fighting the existence of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau. In July 2015 and again in February 2017, Texas
Republican Senator Ted Cruz submitted a bill to do away with
the bureau, claiming the bureau’s _“financial activism...stunt(s)
economic growth.” _22 Where does this idea come from that American
business can’t grow and make profits when it is required to meet
ethical behavior standards and be held accountable when it cheats
consumers? Doing away with the meager protections this bureau
provides is part of the 2016 _Republican National Platform_<sup>23</sup> With the
three branches of government under Republican control beginning
in January 2017, if you disagree, and want an agency protecting
consumer interests, speak up. Where does your Congressman stand?

Generally, the central Fed is there to serve the interests of its
members, who are the primary movers in our money system. They do
not serve the interests of the people.
