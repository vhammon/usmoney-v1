So, what makes money, money? What characteristics must an object
have before communities use it to buy and sell with each other?

## Community-wide agreement

A community must agree to use the token as an intermediary when
they buy and sell. If everyone in a community agrees cowry shells
will be used as money, cowry shells will be the money. Agreement
is a product of governance: an all-powerful individual may dictate
cowry shells will be money, or on the other end of the spectrum, an
egalitarian decision-making community may decide they will use
cowry shells for their money.

## A token

A money token can be made of many things – from cowry shells,
giant stones, precious metals, and paper to virtual digital bits and
bytes. So, what money is made of does not make it money. But, it
does have to be made of something recognizable and securable.

## Authentic

No matter what money is made of, counterfeiting will always be a
concern. So an authority is needed to guarantee authenticity. Such
authorities can be an individual who differentiates between real
cowry shells and counterfeits of bone or stone; an assayist who tests
the weight and purity of gold, and stamps it into coins of guaranteed
value; a government (monarchy to democracy) that use special
papers, imprints, and even holographic images for paper money –
and dedicates resources to finding and prosecuting counterfeiters. An
authority can be a consortium of computer programmers who claim
their exchange of digital bits and bytes cannot be hacked. Whatever
the choice of token, a token is useful only if it is guaranteed to be
authentic and not easily counterfeited.

## Trustworthy

Trustworthiness requires some kind of guarantee of continuing value;
if you take a dollar in payment today, you want to know you will be
able to use it to buy something that costs a dollar tomorrow. While
some of this trustworthiness comes from the authority guaranteeing
authenticity, money also carries with it a promise of value from the
past, present or the future. Whether the value resides in the past,
present or future depends on the money system.

### Past

A community can issue money based on a history and reputation
for trustworthiness. When we say the US dollar is backed by the full
faith and credit of the nation, we are claiming our reputation for
trustworthiness, established in the past, will continue into the future
and guarantee our money.

### Present

A community can issue money based on natural resources and the
wealth built up over generations – value created in the past and
existing now. When we say the US dollar is backed by the common
wealth of the nation, we mean as a nation we have a store of equity
that can be drawn on to make our dollar promises good. We have a
wealth of sustainable resources.

### Future

A community can issue money based on wealth to be created in the
future. In a money system that creates new money by issuing an
IOU for future value, the promise of trustworthiness is dependent on
the ability of the borrowers to produce the value in the future and
pay off the loans. We are saying that we have invested in our nation,
we can maintain our assets into the future, remain productive, and
guarantee our money. The trustworthiness of this promise depends
 on preserving a community of educated, innovative, healthy people
living and working in safe, healthy and productive jobs.
Money systems can combine these means to trustworthiness.

### Creation & destruction

Whatever the choice of token, it must be turned into money in use
by some process. And there will be another process that removes
money from use and/or destroys it. Someone must find cowry
shells. Someone must mine gold (or historically, have the wealth,
power, army or security forces, to steal it from and/or control those
who do the actual mining), coin it and stamp it. Paper tokens must
be printed and introduced into the economy as money by some
authority. Digital bits and bytes must be created by someone’s
keystrokes. Once created money can be entered into an economy as
debt, as a credit, or as equity.

The power to change a commodity – real or virtual, or an IOU piece of
paper, or digital bits and bytes into negotiable currency is enormous.
Imagine the power to create money and all the advantages that
brings. Without thoughtful and extensive controls, this power will
override any and all other power in a community. Choosing who
or what creates the money is choosing who will rule. This is such an
important concept it is worth repeating:

**Whoever creates the money will rule.**

Money can be destroyed. Cowry shells can be smashed. Gold coins
can be melted into bullion and used in jewelry, electronics, medicine,
or manufacturing, removing them from the money token pool. Paper
can burn. Digital bits and bytes can vanish with a keystroke.

Whatever the money token, people who are able to accumulate
an extraordinary amount of it are able to influence, or control the
amount in circulation by simply removing enough or flooding
the supply to suit their purpose. In any system that allows a few
individuals to control significant percentages of the total wealth,
these individuals will be able to control the amount of money in the
economy. Hence they will be able to control its value and **the value
of all else in the economy.
**

This gives people of great wealth a secondary power to introduce
money into the economy or remove it at will, effectively creating or
destroying it temporarily, no matter what the chosen system. Some
systems amplify this power and other systems keep it in check.

## The essence

The **token** used for money can be anything material or virtual, so the
essence of money is not the stuff of which it is made. Some argue real
money must have tangible, marketplace value, but the evidence says
otherwise.

**Authenticity and trustworthiness** are of critical importance to well-
functioning money, but there have been periods in history when
counterfeiting has been rampant, and the false token functioned as
money – for a time. So authenticity and trustworthiness are very
important characteristics, but they are not the essence of money.

Anything manmade is by definition, **created.** And, anything man
creates can be **destroyed.** So, this characteristic is not money’s essence.

Which leaves us with the essence of money: community-wide
agreement to use something in particular as money. The essence
of money is the intangible – but very real nonetheless – agreement
of people in a community. How agreement is reached is a
separate matter.

**Money is a token that can be authenticated and held trustworthy,
chosen by a community to act as an intermediary in exchanges.
Money can be created or destroyed.**

_That which is essential cannot be seen with the human eye._
— Antoine Saint Exupery, _The Little Prince,_ 1943
