- The middle class is shrinking and poverty is growing.
- Jobs are going overseas.
- The top one percent is getting richer while everyone else
    gets poorer.
- Our infrastructure is falling apart.
- Taxes and government debt are high.
- States and the federal government are in crisis with serious
    budget shortfalls.
- Thirty percent of American corporate profits go to the
    financial sector.
- We have immigration issues.
- We spend huge amounts on weapons and war.

Why, why, why?

## Our present money system pushes us toward these outcomes

There is not a direct cause and effect, but our monetary system
establishes parameters and pressures that make these outcomes
predictable and alternative outcomes nearly impossible.

We are social animals who exchange the things we value. Because
money is our primary tool to facilitate exchanges, our money system
sets boundaries, lays tracks that become ruts, and at a deep and fundamental level determines the nature of our society. We can have
all the conversations we want about how to:

- reduce our deficit
- cut taxes
- get right size government
- strengthen our middle class
- stabilize our financial sector
- reestablish trust in government
- stem illegal immigration
- assure enough jobs
- assure that help for those in need does not foster crippling
    dependency
- assure businesses on Main Street thrive
- maintain and sustain our infrastructure and natural resources for
    future generations

But, even when we make some small improvements here or there, our
current monetary system, the bedrock of our economy, determines
most of our current outcomes. Until we look clearly at our money
system, and make it truly match our values, we will keep getting what
we are getting – at exponentially increasing magnitude.

## River to the sea

This book’s discussion of our money is a distillation to make the basic
system clear. Life is far more complicated of course, but the math is
indisputable. The bones of the money system are mathematical, and matter, because the money system is structural and determines how
resources move around in our economy.
Since the money system is complex, there can be positive and
negative outcomes along the way. This means if you start looking
for anecdotal evidence of good or bad results, you can find plenty
of both. A money system can dictate that resources and wealth shift
toward those who already have wealth, and away from the people
who produce it. At the same time, the rules of the game – economic
policy – can allow people to rise from rags to riches, and allow some
businesses to prosper, and some individuals to make their fortune
on hard work alone. It’s critically important to look deeper than
anecdotes at the nation as a whole and at the money system itself.

Think of the earth’s water cycle as a metaphor for our money system.
Moisture evaporates from the ocean, is carried as rain to land, falls,
and then flows again to the sea. This is the fundamental water
system. Along the way, some water sinks into the ground to maintain
aquifers. Some is soaked up by plants. Some is dammed. Some flows
into streams and ripples along. Some flows into farms, lakes and
reservoirs. There can be droughts and floods and hurricanes and the
soft patter of rain on thirsty crops. The benefits and burdens of the
system are extensive and complex. AND the general cycle exists with
certainty. Earth’s water cycle is a closed system: shifts and changes
occur as water moves through the system, but it moves in a consistent
directional cycle.

A money system has an irrefutable mathematical core with
predictable system-level outcomes. At the same time, money will
eddy and flow, flood and dry up, and swirl into beneficial or
destructive individual outcomes.

A money system can be designed to function like the water cycle: a
closed system where money circulates in complex ways, sometimes
constrained, sometimes freely shifting around for all sorts of reasons,
while the amount of money remains essentially or proportionally
the same.

Or the money system can be designed so there is a one-directional transfer of wealth from those who produce value to those with the
power to create an expanding supply of new money.
In our water system metaphor, this would be the equivalent of having
a giant straw touching down somewhere and sucking up a steady
portion of the water on the planet. Most would agree this is a very
bad idea.

A money system with a fundamental one-directional transfer of
wealth requires an exponentially growing supply of money – so that
there is money for basic exchanges _and_ money to skim off the top for
the wealthy few new money-creators. Because this latter system is the
one predominantly used worldwide, it is important to understand
what exponential growth means, because in a closed system – and all
natural systems are closed – exponential growth inevitably leads to
collapse..
