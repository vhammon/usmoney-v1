### 4.33 Making a Deal with the Devil – Grand Bargain: A National Central Bank and Privately Created Legal Tender.

11 FRED–Economic Research Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “Commercial Banks
in the U.S., (Q4)1983 to (Q4)2017.” Economic Data. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/
series/USNUM
NOTE: It’s taken me years to write this and I’ve updated information many times.
Some changes are stunning. The number of banks reported by the St. Louis FED
dropped 8% in just 2 years, from 5,309 in 2015 to 4,888 in 2017. The graph is
nearly a straight line down. That’s a rapid and exponential monopolization. And,
the FDIC has slightly different numbers...4,918 institutions.

of March 28, 2018.
NOTE: In 2015 the CFTC ruled that Bitcoins are not money, they are commodities.
By 2018, their published information describes Bitcoin as a “convertible virtual
currency. Virtual currency is a digital representation of value that functions as a
medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value.” AND, they say,
“Yes, virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, have been determined to be commodities
under the Commodity exchange Act (CEA).”
