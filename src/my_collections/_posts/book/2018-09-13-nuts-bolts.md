## The old: bank money

In review, our current money is the private banking sector’s note or IOU;
it is created as a promise to produce future value. Today, banks create
new money when they take your IOU and put it on the asset side of
their own accounting ledger. At the same time, they create their own
IOU that goes on the liability side of their ledger because they promise
to produce that amount of money when you ask. The two entries net
out to zero. When you pay the loan back, the bank crosses out your
IOU in its asset column and crosses out their own IOU in the liability
column. Poof! Money was created. Poof! Money was extinguished and
the money supply was reduced.

## The new: OUR money

Our new money will be common wealth money. It is equity money,
and can only be created by our government – given, spent, invested,
or lent into circulation. Banks will only be able to loan existing money
that they own or that someone lends them to loan out. Banks will no
longer have the privilege of creating money for our nation.

### From the private banks’ perspective

Banks will have three general accounts:

**1. The banks’ own operating accounts**
**2. Investment accounts.** If you choose to have the bank invest for
    you, you hand over ownership of your money to the bank and
       they give you an IOU. Your money becomes a cash asset on their
       ledger, and their IOU to you is a liability of the bank. That is
       the same thing that happens today when you loan your money
       to the bank for a fixed period and they give you a certificate
       of deposit (CD). The bank markets investment opportunities
according to the risk, return, and level of guarantee. People
loan the bank their money. The bank invests this money and
pays them an agreed upon return. People decide how the bank
invests their money by choosing investment funds that match
their priorities and desired risk.

**3. Transaction accounts.** THIS is new and different: _Depositors’_
    _accounts are now trust accounts in a fund accounting system._ They
       are no longer part of the banks’ own balance sheet. Each bank
    customer’s account is kept as a separate fund account, in the
       same way an attorney or title company would hold an escrow
       account. The _sum total_ of a bank’s customer deposits is held as
       a single accounting record **at the central bank,** making trans-
    fers between banks faster and easier, much as it is today. The
    central bank does not have any specific information about depos-
    itor accounts, just the sum total. Your bank keeps track of your
    money for you and transfers it to others only with your permis-
       sion and instructions. Just as today, at the central bank, the banks
       only transfer the net required, but now it is being transferred
    between the consolidated depositor trust accounts, managed by
    the private banks, and held at the central bank.

If and when a bank performs poorly and goes broke, no depositor will
be at risk of losing their money; it will be untouched in a trust fund
account at the central bank. Another bank can buy the management
of these accounts just as they do today when a bank is sold, and service
would be seamless for the customer. There will be no need for deposit
insurance, which will reduce the cost of our money system, banking,
and hence the cost of everything.

Your bank will provide you with important services: storing, keeping
an account, and transferring your money. You will have to pay for this
service. There will no longer be free banking. Basic banking service fees
are estimated at $75–100 each year. Fees for investment services will be
based on risk, supply and demand and other market forces.

I hope by now you know that paying a direct annual fee for deposit
account services will be a steal compared to the amount of money
currently going out of your pocket to the banking and financial sector.
These fees will be a deliberate choice on your part instead of an invis-
ible drain.

There will no longer be what we now call _savings accounts._ If you want
your money to be 100% safe, leave it in your transaction account. If you
want it to be earning something, then invest it in the investment fund
of your choice, at the risk level you want, and matching your values and
priorities. This takes back the power of an individual to make choices
about how their money is invested, instead of giving this power to the
bankers and hiding it from the public. There is risk in an investment
account, you can lose your money if you choose poorly. This expanded
national pool of investors will in aggregate produce better outcomes.

### From the central bank’s perspective

Our new money is equity money; it is part of our common wealth and
gets its unit value from what it can be exchanged for in the economy. It
is an asset on our national accounts. Our new money does not need to
be booked as a liability against anything, and it will not be created in
exchange for anything. Our US dollars are assets for two reasons: they
represent our common wealth, and they are in themselves a national
common wealth asset. Money is a social technology that we jointly agree
to use and own together. As a shared technology, it is a very valuable
asset when its value is well maintained.

It’s easiest to understand how this system works by comparing it to the
way coins work today. Today, our government buys raw materials and
turns them into coins. It issues the coins at a chosen face value. The
seignorage – the difference between the cost to make them and their
face value – is entered into the US Government’s accounts as income.

In the new system most of our money will be created and issued as an
electronic entry, just as it is today. In the same way seignorage from
current coin production is entered on our books as a kind of income,
newly created money will be entered as new income and be a cash asset
on our government’s books.

A transition can be made to the new system without disrupting commerce
in any way. The change can take place with a few changes in account-
ing rules, a few accounting entries and some startup entries for the new
Bank of the United States. For a detailed explanation of the accounting
changes read, _Modernizing Money; Why our monetary system is broken
and how it can be fixed_ by Andrew Jackson and Ben Dyson (2012), the
founders of the British organization PositiveMoney.org. There are some
differences in the British and American systems, but understanding their
explanations will be valuable.

### The accounting transition

The private banks’ balance sheets will not change in terms of their net.
The money that the banks created – currently represented in their liabil-
ity column as IOUs from the bank system to their customers (Federal
Reserve Notes) – becomes IOUs from the individual bank to the US
government. It will be as if they borrowed the money they are lending
out from the US government, instead of creating it.

All deposit liabilities of the private banks will be transferred to an aggre-
gated depositor _trust_ account held at the central bank for the individual
private bank. These accounting entries will be made on the day of
implementation:

1. BANK LIABILITIES CHANGE

On the banks’ accounts, the deposit liabilities will be re-designated as
IOUs to the US government.

2. US BANK BALANCING ENTRY

On the books of the Bank of the United States, a sum equal to that of the
deposit liabilities will be entered as an asset IOU from the private bankers.

The amount of money in the supply will not change with this transi-
tion. Under our current system, if everyone paid the banks back the
money they have borrowed tomorrow, it would wipe out our money
supply. But, in our new system, when money-creation loans are paid
back to the banks, the banks will cancel the loan asset, pay the amount
to the US Bank, and cancel their own liability IOU. The banks pay the
returned money to the US government as if it had borrowed the money
from our common wealth. The money supply will remain the same.

In the US Government account at the Bank of the United States (our
new central bank), the IOUs of the private banks are entered as an asset.
This represents our money supply. As the banks pay off their loans to
us, these assets change on the balance sheet from private bank IOUs to
cash assets.

While the banks will continue to manage and serve their deposit custom-
ers, they will no longer be able to use deposits for their own purposes.
(This will make real what most people believe is already true.) They
will manage your personal accounts, and transfer your funds on your
demand. At the end of day when a net of transactions is transferred
from one bank to another, it will simply be an accounting entry at the
central bank, just as it is today. You will experience no difference.

Most importantly, the banks can no longer turn around and create new
money by issuing another loan. They will have to actually have money
from investors in order to make another loan. Yes, this will be a dramatic
change to their operating model. They will need to figure out how to
play on the same level field that every other business in the nation plays
on; they will no longer have special privileges.

The transition to our new system will be complete when the money the
private bankers created by issuing loans is repaid and transferred to the
US Government accounts. The majority of this transfer will happen
within a few years. Today to keep the money supply in circulation,
most big bank loans are made to property speculators and Wall Street
gamblers who make very short-term loans. Small community banks
have been carrying the burden of making loans to Main Street busi-
nesses, and can continue to do so as more people have more savings to
invest. There will be a small percentage of 30-year mortgage and busi-
ness capital investment loans held for the full-time, but the amount is
likely to be small and relatively inconsequential.

## ADJUSTMENT

While the change is simple – a few accounting entries – it is profound.
It will radically change the role of banks.

Banks will have to make some significant changes to their business
model, and we can give them a transition time. We could allow them
to borrow back from the government a diminishing percentage of their
previous portfolio, at minimal, but increasing interest rates. For exam-
ple, for the first year after the change, the banks could borrow back from
the government 80 percent of loan repayments at say, 0.5 percent inter-
est for the first year. They could then use this money to reissue loans
with a maximum 5-year run time. The second year, they could retain
a maximum of 60 percent and pay a fee of one percent interest to the
government. The 3rd year, 40 percent retained at 1.5 percent interest.
The 4th year, 20 percent retained at 2 percent interest. And, no retention
allowed after that. This would avoid a cold turkey shock to the banking
establishment and give them time to find their new legs. That is being
much kinder to them than they have been to the general public, but
we can afford to be kind.
