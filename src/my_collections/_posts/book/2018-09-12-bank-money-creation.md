> _The essence of the contemporary monetary system is creation of money, out
> of nothing, by private banks’ often foolish lending._

— Martin Wolf, Financial Times, November 9, 2010<sup>16</sup>

There is a natural immature human inclination to find a way around
the rules if a tangible, immediate reward is at hand. History shows
us we need our collective grownup selves in the form of governance
to set limits and curtail bad behavior – especially in the face of
enormous temptation. What greater temptation than the privilege of
creating money?

Over the past century, the banks of the world with the privilege
of creating our money, have managed a steady deregulation of the
banking sector that in practice removed deposit reserve requirements
and nearly any meaningful capital-equity requirements. Great Britain
removed reserve requirements in 1888. The US still has some reserve
requirements in place, but they are readily, routinely and legally
circumvented. For at least the past 50 years in the US, the multiplier
model of reserve banking has hardly applied to US banking and
money creation, although it is still taught in economics classes, and
we still call our banking system, The Federal _Reserve_ System. So,
once the reserve requirements are gone, and the capital requirements
are almost nonexistent, what determines how much new money
is created?

## The bankers’ moods

The moods of private bankers become the only limit on their creation
of new money through the issuance of credit-debt. When bankers
are confident the economy is perking along and they think they are
likely to be repaid, they create new money by freely handing out new loans. When considering just how freely, think of the NINJA
loans of the early 2000s (No INcome, Job or Assets); banks were
making $500,000 house loans without requiring proof of income,
employment or assets.<sup>17</sup> When the inevitable bubble pops, the
bankers are doom and gloomy and money is tight. People suffer.

Bankers have convinced academics and Congress that this cycle of
boom and bust, exuberance and restraint is a normal economic-
business cycle. It is not. There is a natural _business_ cycle from new, to
we-must-all-have-this, to ho-hum, to gone and forgotten, to the next
new thing. Think of the businesses that boomed and collapsed as we
innovated from phonograph records to the cloud: the manufacturers
of record players, magnetic tape decks, 8-track and then cassette
players. Think of the video stores, and the manufacturers of all the
products supporting these technologies.

There is also the business cycle of a successful bandwagon. Selling
Christmas trees is a ready example of this common business cycle.
If only a few people are selling, they can demand full price and sell
out, making a nice profit. Interested people notice and the next year
more people decide to sell Christmas trees. If in the next year there
are too many sellers, no one will sell their entire inventory, and many
will lose money. Then the year after, there will be only the few who
survived. Of course, this pattern repeats.

## Money force not market force

Our money system inflates the entire economy like a giant balloon
until it pops. The idea that this is a natural economic cycle of boom
and bust is part of the con. An entire economy that cycles from boom
to bust every 7–12 years is only natural in a private money creation
system such as ours; a fractional reserve money creation system is
prone to asset bubbles and market crashes. They are part and parcel
of this system.

**Boom and bust can happen in any business, but it only happens
in an entire economy when the money supply itself is ballooning
and bursting.**

**This is our system now.**
