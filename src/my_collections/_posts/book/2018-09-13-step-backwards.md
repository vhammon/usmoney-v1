_...gold and economic freedom are inseparable, that the gold standard is
an instrument of laissez-faire and that each implies and requires the other._\
— Alan Greenspan in _Gold and Economic Freedom_ (1966), Chair of the Federal Reserve System, 1987–2006^3

Returning to a gold standard is another option that steps backwards.
Proponents of gold money are of different minds: some mean a
gold _standard,_ others mean 100% gold money.

## Gold standard

Some people want us to return to the gold standard, which means
a fractional reserve system in which a small amount of gold backs
up the IOUs of private bankers. Gold is the reference measure of the
value of the money – the standard. Nearly every money system that
used gold as a standard for the past 700 years has been a fractional
reserve system – an unstable system that relies on confidence and so
needs some gravitas. The false idea that there was gold backing your
certificate provided this gravitas.

Proponents see gold as a consistent measure for the value of all
currencies, whether its marketplace value floats, or is controlled at a
set price. Here is a common thread about a new gold standard from
Steve Forbes, of Forbes magazine:

_What should a new gold standard look like? Representative Ted Poe (R-Tex.) has
introduced an original and practical version. Unlike in days of old, we don’t need
piles of the yellow metal for a new standard to operate. Under Poe’s plan – an
approach I have long favored – the dollar would be fixed to gold at a specific
price. For argument’s sake let’s say the peg is $1,300. If the price of gold were to go above that, the Federal Reserve would sell bonds from its portfolio, thereby
removing dollars from the economy to maintain the $1,300 level. Conversely, if
the gold price were to drop below $1,300, the Fed would ‘print’ new money by
buying bonds, thereby injecting cash into the banking system.
An effective gold standard can be that simple. What gets lost in the discussion
is that the yellow metal is merely a means of measuring the value of the dollar.
The fact that a foot has 12 inches doesn’t restrict the number of square feet you
can have in a house. The fact that a pound has 16 ounces doesn’t restrict your
weight, alas – it’s simply a measurement. The virtue of a properly constructed
gold standard is that it’s both stable and flexible – stable in value and flexible
in meeting the marketplace’s natural need for money. (May 27, 2013)^4

Let’s unpack this argument.

_“...We don’t need piles of the yellow metal for a new standard to operate.”_
This tells us Mr. Forbes is not talking about a 100% gold money or
100% receipt money system. He is referring to a fractional reserve or
no reserve, IOU-future value money system, using gold as a measure
only – a _standard._

_“...The Federal Reserve would sell...”_ Here he is talking about supply,
demand and value. The amount of money in a system changes the
value of everything, including the value of a commodity like gold. So,
when there is more money in the system than is needed, the price
of everything goes up, including the price of gold. He’s noting the
Fed will use its power to buy and sell government IOUs to change the
amount of money in the system, just as it does now. He is suggesting
the Fed use the price of gold as the indicator for when to buy or sell.

_“...The yellow metal is merely a means of measuring the value of the
dollar.”_ This is a curious circular argument. Fix the price of gold,
then peg the value of money to the price of gold. If the price of
gold changes, increase or decrease the amount of money in the
system until the price of gold returns to its peg. This argument
assumes the price of gold as a commodity will not change in the
marketplace. It ignores the fact that gold’s commodity value might
change dramatically, having nothing to do with how much money is
in the system. For example, gold might become the only metal that
works for some new technology and the commodity demand could
skyrocket.

Forbes wants to use gold as the indicator light on when there is too
much or too little money in the economy. Since the very rich control
the amount of gold available in the marketplace and consequently its
price, a gold standard assures the very wealthy have power over the
economy as a whole. However, they have more power in our current
system, which is why we haven’t gone back to a gold standard.

## 100% gold money

Some say that they want to switch to a 100% gold system, in which
either the government or private entities offer gold certificates to be
used as money. These certificates would be for a 100% corresponding
value of gold in storage somewhere.

Commodity banks already exist in the marketplace. You can buy and
sell gold, gold shares, and even trade your gold shares for goods and
services, using them essentially as money. How is trust established?
How do you know the stored gold is really there? How do you know
whether a gold seller and storage facility is trustworthy? They may
be running their gold sales/warehouses like the old gold sellers, and
hoping only a small percentage of gold certificate holders will want
their gold at any given time. I’d be quite skeptical of purveyors of
gold who give you warehouse certificates for the gold you buy from
them – especially in an unregulated marketplace! Only some form
of independent oversight can answer those questions and protect
the public.

A dozen or so states have initiated bills to recognize gold and silver
coins issued by the federal government as legal tender. Utah, Texas,
Louisiana and Oklahoma have passed bills into law and established
gold and silver exchange banks. However, the wording of the laws
makes it clear **the primary purpose is to exempt gold and silver
traders from having to pay either sales or capital gains taxes on
their investments stored in gold and silver.** While these gold and
silver coin exchanges can serve as a supplemental currency, they are
primarily a means for the wealthy to store wealth without incurring
any taxes.

In June 2015, Texas passed a law establishing a state-run gold
bullion depository. The depository will store the state’s gold, which
is currently in storage at the federal level, and the facility will be
available to citizens for gold storage. It will provide gold-certificates
for stored gold that can be exchanged. Texas is setting up its own
supplemental money system: a 100% gold commodity system. The
Constitutionality of this is questionable. Though Article 1, Section
10 certainly confuses the issue, _“No State shall...coin money;...make
anything but gold and silver Coin a Tender in payment of debts;...”_

Here’s an advocates spiel (reported word for word in many online
publications without citation):

_Texas’ new depository could help supercharge the growing movement for an
honest and sensible monetary system founded on real money rather than debt-
based paper notes conjured into existence by a private banking cartel. Indeed,
one of the chief aims of gold-and-silver-as-currency proponents is to restore
sound money – and the Texas law could help pave the way.^5_

```
However, as explained in Chapter 4.28, commodity money is neither
_sound,_ nor _honest,_ nor _real_ money. As with any commodity money,
it is vulnerable to the market machinations of the wealthy. Texas
has a long history of advocates who firmly believe the more money
one has, the worthier one is, and the greater power one should have
over public decisions. For an exposition of this belief read the 1960
utopian fantasy, _Alpaca,_ by Texas oil tycoon H.L. Hunt.^6 Research
and history tell us people of great wealth tend to do all they can to
keep it and to get more. There are hundreds of years of reasons to
be wary that the wealthy will manipulate this gold money to their
advantage.

Demonstrating how unsound commodities can be and how much
the rich love to game and conquer the markets, in 1979, Hunt’s sons,
Nelson B. Hunt and William H. Hunt tried to corner the silver
market. They bought and hoarded all the silver they could. They
bought a lot of it on margin, which means they borrowed to buy it,
and owned it like you own your house with a mortgage.

With just the power to borrow, they wreaked havoc on the silver
market. The brothers were estimated to hold one third of the entire
world supply of silver (other than that held by governments). As they
accumulated more and more they sent the price skyrocketing from $
per troy ounce to a record high of $48.70 – an increase of 812 percent.
The lack of silver in the marketplace and the consequently high prices
made it difficult for anyone else to buy silver. The New York jeweler,
Tiffany, took out a full page ad in the New York Times condemning
the Hunts’ silver hoarding which was intended to run up the value of
their stash.^7

There are those who long for the days when gold was a primary
money. Ironically, gold money tends to appeal most to those who
want a bare minimum of government and who think if money is a
commodity the choice to use it and its value will be determined by
individuals in the marketplace. These gold money supporters want
a minimum of government authority over the economy and think
with gold money they will have more personal autonomy; they want
freedom! Yet, they advocate a money system that gives the wealthy
power to control the economy and their lives. They fail to understand
how commodity money functions in an economy and turn a blind
eye to the who and how of money creation, destruction, and the ease
with which a gold currency can be manipulated by a wealthy few.


## A lasting attraction

Gold is the stuff of myths and magic. It is elemental and beautiful.
We make extraordinarily beautiful things of gold to adorn ourselves
and bring us pleasure. Gold commodity value served well to develop
money as an abstract measure. However, we have long moved past
the period of always tangible exchanges into a world of virtual
exchanges at the speed of light. This pushed us to really look at the
essence of money and see beyond the glitter that is gold, to money’s
role as a neutral intermediary.
