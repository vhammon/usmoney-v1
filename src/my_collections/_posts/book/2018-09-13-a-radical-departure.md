A century ago, between 1913 when The Federal Reserve Act was passed
and 1929 when the economy came crashing down, banks with the
power to create new money could also invest it. This ability to self-
deal created a booming economy as a few wealthy people created
money for themselves to buy real estate, invest in new technologies,
monopolize old technologies and live a Gilded Age lifestyle. An asset
bubble was created that burst on October 29, 1929. Within a year
90 percent of the value of the stock market vanished, and the nation
sunk into the Great Depression, which lasted 10 years.

Recognizing that this ability of money creators to self-deal is a
problem, Congress passed the Glass-Steagal Act in 1933, which
required a legal separation between deposit bankers (who get to create
new money by issuing loans) and investment bankers (who gather
investment funds to make investments). This law meant a money
creator bank could not loan itself money for investment; a bank
could not create money for its own, or a subsidiary’s risky investing.

However, by the late 1990s Wall Street had found so many creative
ways to get around Glass-Steagal, they could successfully argue it
wasn’t really a meaningful law in practice. In 1999, bankers convinced
Congress and President Clinton that the _Glass-Steagal Act_ was
old-fashioned hooey – an unnecessary constriction on their activities
in this modern world of hedging risk, never failing, always wise
profit-taking. _The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,_ euphemistically called the
_Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999,_ was passed.

The law went into effect in 2000. It took a brief seven years of bankers’
self-interested gambling to bring several big banks to insolvency and
put the entire economy at risk of collapse. In October 2007, our
stock market had hit an all-time bubble high of 14,164. Within 18
months the value had dropped more than 50 percent to 6,595. **There
has been no substantial systemic correction.** _The Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act_ (2010) made some feeble
efforts at risk containment, but a Republican Congress in June 2018,
gutted many of the protective regulations.

A continuing flood of newly created money loaned into the financial
sector pushed the stock market back up beyond its 2007 high of
14,200, to over 26,617 in January 2018. After this high, the market
began showing the little fits and drops that presage a major meltdown.
By June the market had dropped 4.86 percent to 25,384. It doesn’t
take much foresight to see trouble is ahead.

## Quantitative Easing

### — when the central Fed’s loan programs are not enough

Over nearly a century, the central Fed took three basic actions: it
managed loans between the banks of their reserves; it created new
money for the banks by giving them direct loans; and it bought and
sold US Securities to the banks and the general public.

In 2008, this was not enough to keep most of the major banks
solvent. As the economy crashed, the central bank tried to create
enough money for the insolvent banks by issuing them loans. When
this proved inadequate, the central Fed decided it could create new
money by buying up the insolvent banks’ sour investments, or the
sour investments of businesses that owed the banks money.
So, the central Fed echoed the freedom that the _Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act_ gave their member banks: it created money to make investments
on its own behalf. It started in a convoluted way. Congress passed
the _Troubled Asset Relief Program,_ otherwise known as _TARP._ This
authorized the Fed to create $700 billion in new money guaranteed
by IOUs from the US Government. This was standard US government
IOU-debt procedure.

But Congress authorized the Fed to use this money to buy a variety of
toxic assets from struggling banks and private companies, including
stock ownership in the companies themselves. Some call this strategy
quantitative easing because it increases the quantity of money in
the whole system by feeding it to the big players in the financial
sector – which takes the stress of consequences off their shoulders
and makes their lives easier. New money on their balance sheets eases
the financial sector’s distress. In theory, their newfound comfort will
trickle down to the rest of the economy. It does not.

The Fed bought toxic assets from an insurance company (AIG), from
mortgage companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and from the
investment arms of banks. Most of these purchases were at a market
high valuation instead of the current market value. If the banks and
companies had been required to mark their portfolios at after-crash
values, nearly all of them would have been insolvent. Most of these
Fed purchases were repurchase agreements that required the original
owners to buy back their investments once the market value came
back up, and to pay an interest premium in the interim. It was a
gamble on the part of Congress that put taxpayer debt on the line for
these investments. It was a gamble on the part of the central Fed: they
became a market player taking a risk the borrowers would be able to
make the premiums and/or the assets would return to their previous
book value. **This was a radical departure from their previous scope
of action.**

Their gamble paid off. The Fed made money on these deals, and
after expenses, passed an additional $50–70 billion on to the Federal
Government’s operating fund for several years. As for most gamblers,
this early win made this high-risk strategy seem like a sure bet.

### Fertilizer for self-dealing

These maneuvers meant a massive shift of new cash money onto
the balance sheets of the financial sector, where it could continue
to be played in the financial markets to rake in double digit profits,
swinging the financial sector of the economy back into boom mode.
High profit margins from gaming, or facilitating speculation, meant
the big bank players were not very interested in loaning to Main
Street. A Main Street starved of credit-money, meant a very slow
recovery for the national economy. However, the financial sector, the
market gamers and the global businesses have been doing just fine.
They have been raking in some of their biggest profits for years – and
creating a new asset bubble in the process. But, wages have stagnated,
and small Main Street businesses hang on by their fingernails because
few people can afford to spend. By mid 2018, this is changing some
with modest job additions and unusually low unemployment – all
typical of a pre-crash high.

While the Fed’s new strategy worked to keep the banks and the
economy afloat in the short-term, it opened the flood gates of self-
dealing even further. The central Fed is now heavily into this game. It
reported $906 billion in assets in 2008. In 2009 the central Fed more
than doubled its assets to $2,007 billion. By 2016 (November) – just
seven more years – its assets had grown to $4,453 billion. Most of the
TARP IOUs have been repurchased and no longer sit on their books,
so the Fed has clearly been using this new found strategy to pump
up their asset column (which means creating new money). A central
bank that has increased its assets more than 5-fold in 10 years should
trigger clanging alarm bells. If you know where to listen, there are
little tinkles on the edges of general awareness. A humongous crash
is coming.

### Mortgage-backed Securities

The housing market has soared past its 2007 median home value of
$196K to $216K in June 2018.^60

While the central Fed may have gotten the TARP purchases off its
books, it still increased its IOUs from _others,_ which includes mortgage-
backed security assets from $1,101 billion in 2011 to $1,819 billion in
2016 [(next section).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-5/section-54) This suggests it is still using its power to create
money to keep toxic assets off the books of marginally solvent big
players, specifically the government-sponsored enterprises like Freddie
Mac and Fannie Mae. Or, it decided it likes participating in investing
in the marketplace in hopes of great returns on its investments. In
either case, it pumped $664 billion into Wall Street investments in 5
years. Compare this $664 billion 5-year investment in Wall Street by
the Fed to the $388 billion investment our Government made in our
national transportation infrastructure and operations over the same
period of time. Does that seem like a sensible priority?

From 2006 to 2016, the Fed increased its assets by 18 percent every
year on average [(Next section)!](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-5/section-54) Think of that exponential curve. The
Fed is trying to cope with our nearly vertical ascent up the money
creation curve. Common sense says it cannot keep this up.

### US Government Debt – Treasury Securities

To keep up with the exponentially increasing rate of money creation
by the private sector, US Government debt to the public grew at an
annual rate of 11 percent, more than doubling since 2008. In 2008
US government debt to the public was $5,836 billion. In 2017 it was
$14,724 – an increase of $8,888 billion – two and one half times what
it was 10 years earlier.^61

In 2016, of $4,453 billion in assets on the central Fed’s balance sheet,
$2,567 billion was in US Treasury securities – up from $784 billion in

2006. So of that increase of $8,888 billion in US Government debt,
      $1,783 billion is sitting on the Fed’s balance sheet. Twenty percent
          of the increase in government debt is sitting with the central Fed
      [(Chapter 5.54).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-5/section-54) In the past, member banks, big corporations and
      the general public held most of the US Government debt. So much
      sitting on the Fed’s balance sheet is unusual.

The central Fed appears to be propping up the value of our nation’s
debt by keeping an increasing amount of it on its own books. This is
a short term fix with dire consequences.

This suggests that given the near guarantee of solvency support, the
banks and big corporations may not feel they need to keep so many
US Government IOUs on hand. And, there may be other reasons why
the market for US Government securities dropped. It may reflect a
global lack of confidence in the US’s ability to back up our promises,
and hence a stagnating demand for our IOUs.

The Pew Research Center’s polls of how people in the rest of the
world view America has been a roller coaster for the past 16 years.
During the G.W. Bush era, opposition to US foreign policy and
rising anti-Americanism dropped favorability ratings into the teens
(meaning less than 20 percent of people viewed the US favorably).^62

Under President Obama, ratings rose to a global median of
64 percent expressing a favorable opinion of our country. Ratings
for President Trump are overwhelmingly negative. A median of
just 22 percent say they have at least some confidence in the Trump
to do the right thing in world affairs; 74 percent have little to no
confidence in him.

While many of his supporters like to thumb their nose at the
opinions of the rest of the world, global opinions have real world
consequences given our money system. Notice the low favorability
for G.W. Bush’s policies and the market crash in 2007–2008. High
favorability for Obama and we had eight years of slow, but steady
improvement. These are correlations, not causes, but they suggest
there will be a financial crash early on in Trump’s presidency.

When the world doubts we are strong and spending wisely on our
national well-being, they will doubt the value of our money and the
trustworthiness of our debt. And, **this has consequences.**
