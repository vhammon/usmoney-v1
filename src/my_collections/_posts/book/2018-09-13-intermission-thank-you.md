Thanks for reading this far! I know that Chapter 6 was a downer - a dismal litany of things gone wrong. I know it includes strong
    opinions. I’ve done my best to weed out the unsupported
    suppositions. Please let me know where I failed and I’ll make
    corrections.

But, when we know where we are, and know where we want to go,
we can move toward our goals.
