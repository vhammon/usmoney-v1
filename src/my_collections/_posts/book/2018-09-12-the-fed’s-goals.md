— _The Federal Reserve: Its Purposes and Functions,_ 9th Edition, 2005

We gave away the power to create 99 percent of our new money to
the private banking sector, only retaining a right to appoint a Board
of Governors that will in theory guide this money system. The
law granting this power mandates that the Board _seek to promote_
certain goals – a loosey-goosey, pretty-please, if-you-can maybe sort
of mandate.

### Seek to promote effectively...

I can only think of one thing as seductive as the ability to create
money: sex. Imagine putting naked teenagers into a dark room
and asking them to seek to promote chastity and safe sex. That’s
comparable to giving private bankers the power to create as much
money as their mood allows, in a minimally regulated, private
enterprise, profit-driven system and asking them to “seek to promote
maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest
rates.” History and common sense tell us it does not work.

## 1. Maximum employment

Why is employment a goal of a banking system? Because the Fed is
not merely a banking system; it creates new money for our economy,
and the supply of money has an impact on whether people – wage
earners and business owners – can flourish. Employment is the
heart of an economy. The Fed is mandated to use the amount of
unemployment as a barometer of how well the amount of money
in the system matches the needs of the economy – from their
point of view.

However, there is no definition of _maximum_ in the law and it will
mean different things to different segments of the population. When
there is plenty of money, and even too much money for a time, the
economy will accelerate and there will be low unemployment. There
could be a job for everyone who wants to work. People who work for
a living can pick and choose to a greater extent. This puts competitive
pressure on employers to increase wages and improve working
conditions, which cuts into owners’ profits. This spreads more wealth
around and benefits those who work for others for a living.

When there is not enough money, the economy will slow, throwing
people out of work. A higher level of unemployment puts working
people at a disadvantage; the employers have the advantage and can
pick and choose, cut benefits, and ignore safety because people need
a job to live. Higher unemployment is a benefit to the owners of
invested wealth because they can increase their profits at the expense
of their employees.

Determining a maximum unemployment rate is a question of values.
Some consider the exploitation of labor by a wealthy few natural
and acceptable, even desirable. Some consider a balance between the
rights and well-being of employees and owners to be optimum.

Policy and practice have defined it as a steady 5–6 percent
unemployment, which is a rate that suits business owners better than
employees. We have chosen a system that deliberately aims to make
it impossible for five or six people out of every 100 to find work,
tolerating levels of nearly ten during the economic downturns that
are inevitable. It is unfair to blame the unemployed when we have
chosen a system that intentionally mandates their unemployment.
This is the value we live by now.

In a neutral and stable money system, employment sorts itself out in
the marketplace. Sometimes it will be to the advantage of labor and
sometimes to the advantage of business owners. Like a real business cycle, it will be business specific, not economy-wide; there might
be too few nurses and they can demand a high wage, or too many
combustion engine mechanics when all vehicles are electric.

However, in our current system, the Fed acts on the belief that its
goal is to keep _overall_ employment in the sweet spot for big and
global business owners. The general idea seems to be to maximize
the profits going to the owners of invested capital without throwing
the nation into dissolution or depression – but, a little pain for small
business and the working class is considered the nature of things.
In this regard, the Fed has been overachieving. It makes as much
sense to keep it in the sweet spot for the majority of citizens, but
that requires a different set of values about human worth and capital
ownership.

## 2. Stable prices

_The Federal Reserve Act of 1913_ specifies an elastic value money system;
it declares our intent to steadily reduce the value of our money by
expanding the supply beyond that required by economic needs. The
Fed board sets a target rate of 2 percent annual devaluation.<sup>18</sup> Earn
$1 this year. It will be worth $$0.98 next year (or less).To reduce
the value of our money at the desired rate, the money supply must
increase 2 percent beyond increases required by population growth
and productivity. Then with too much money chasing goods, services
and property, the value of each dollar will go down and prices
will go up. The governing board, independent of elected oversight,
determines what monetary policies will best meet this demand to
overgrow the money supply.

Given our system choice, _“promoting stable prices”_ is an impossible
goal for the Fed; _stable_ means a steady and acceptable-to-some
decline in the value of our money – also called _inflation._ Some
consider inflation’s steady dollar decline a form of taxation – but
often mistakenly believe the tax is going to government. It is not. It
is going to the bankers who create our money. A fractional reserve
money creation system that allows new money to carry interest will
always be an exponentially increasing money supply with a declining
value. Unless increases are carefully controlled to stay within the increases in population and productivity, the value of the money will
decrease. Our system does not have these controls. It’s disingenuous
to call this deliberately depreciating money, _stable._

## 3. Moderate long-term interest rates

In a commonwealth money system, interest rates would be about
the supply and demand for capital in the marketplace. When there
are more people with savings to invest than there are borrowers
and investment opportunities, the savers might need to accept low
interest rates and investment returns. When few savings are available
to loan or invest, savers and investors could earn premium interest
rates and returns.

However, while it is an available choice, we do not have a
commonwealth money system, yet. In our current system, the price
of money (how much interest you have to pay to borrow it) is not so
much determined by supply and demand. It is determined by how
confident the bankers are about the future and how many people
they can rope into borrowing.

The Governors of the Fed system once thought they could influence
the interest rates by setting the rate at which banks could borrow
from the central Fed when their reserves were low. The idea was if
the banks had to borrow from the Fed at a higher rate to establish
reserves, they would lend at a higher rate. Fewer people would
borrow, reducing the money supply. However, the Fed acknowledges
this influence is minimal. The Fed sets a _target_ rate for interbank
lending and sets a rate for central bank reserve lending (money
creation) to accommodate the money creation of the independent
bankers _after_ the private, independent banks have created the money.
According to the Fed, there is about a three-month lag between the
creation of money by the private banking sector and the creation by
the central bank of the needed reserves and government debt.<sup>19</sup>

As the shadow banking sector has grown, and as the banks have
created more new money for each other’s gaming, the connection
between the growing size of the money supply and interest rates has
drastically diminished. The Fed certainly has little influence over the
interest rates, so the goal of moderate interest rates is an exercise in
futility.

## 4. Ensure the safety and soundness of the nation’s banking and financial system and protect the credit rights of consumers.

These outcomes are compromised by the choice of a fractional reserve
money creation system in the hands of private parties. This system is
inherently unstable and prone to cycles of euphoric lending (which
increases the money supply, creating asset bubbles) and crashes
(which severely reduce the money supply, creating widespread
dysfunction.)

To counterbalance these risks inherent in this system, the Fed
establishes banking rules, regulations and standards, requires
reporting from its members, and audits their reporting.

## How the Fed achieves its goals

In the next section we consider what powers the Federal Reserve
Board has to meet its mandates.
