Our money system makes a government of, by, and for the people
impossible. We are not now created equal in the eyes of the law.
However, we still have our Constitutional authority to elect people to
leadership who will restore our democratic republic.

For hundreds of years, when governments attempted to create new
money, they have been attacked and manipulated into returning
the power of money creation to an elite in the private sector. Early
on in the history of fractional reserve money creation, the bankers
were taking this power away from monarchs and despots. In the
last two hundred years, they have been taking this power away from
constitutional democratic republics (as well as some dictators). Our
quality of life suffers.

## Diminishing trust and kindness

Democratic decision-making requires a level of kindness, respect,
and trust. Several sets of studies compiled by Berkeley psychologists
Paul Piff and Dacher Keltner have found increasing wealth makes
one less ethical, less compassionate and concerned for the welfare
of others, and more likely to lie. Lies, cheating, and fraud destroy
trust. Unkindness follows. So, increasing income disparity and the
concentration of power in the wealthy does not bode well for the
general welfare and domestic tranquility of our democratic republic.^220

## Corrupt politics

When private bankers create our money, they can afford to buy
Congress. And they do. A 2014 study by political scientists Martin
Gilens of Princeton, and Benjamin Page of Northwestern, found, 

_the preferences of rich people had a much bigger impact on subsequent policy
decisions than the views of middle-income and poor Americans. Indeed, the
opinions of lower-income groups, and the interest groups that represent them,
appear to have little or no independent impact on policy. ...Our analyses suggest that majorities of the American public actually have little influence over the
policies our government adopts.221_

Their study found when fairly large majorities of citizens disagree
with economic elites and/or with the powerful money interests, they
generally lose. They note _“If policymaking is dominated by powerful
business organizations and a small number of affluent Americans, then
America’s claims to being a democratic society are seriously threatened.”_
This is not a surprise. This study confirms what we experience.

## Corrupt elections

### Campaign Donors

Up until the last decade, we had election laws that limited how much
any one citizen could spend on election campaigning. The laws
were getting threadbare as wealthy individuals worked under the
radar creating grassroots organizations, think tanks, non-profits, and
engaged churches in political campaigning. Then, the floodgates were
opened after the US Court of Appeals decision in Speechnow v. FEC
in 2010.^222 When money equals speech, those who have more money
get to have a bigger say in our elections. And, they do.

We now have Super Political Action Committees (PACS) that spend
unlimited money on federal election campaigns – running ads or
sending mail or communicating messages specifically advocating for
or against the election of a specific candidate – and there are no limits
or restrictions on the sources of funds used. In 2016, according to
Bloomberg, nearly half of all money spent on campaigns was spent by
PACS – and that half was over $4 billion!^223

The amount of spending on elections has increased 600 percent
since 1980, and, like our exponential curve, began a steep climb off
the chart in 2004. Up through 2000, from $100–300 million was
spent on presidential elections. The 2000 election broke $1 billion,
and by 2012 spending was up to $3 billion for the presidential
election alone.^224

In 1980, the top 25 percent of campaign donors contributed roughly 58 percent of all individual funds. By 2010 they gave 85 percent. By
2016 they gave 93 percent. By 2016, the top 5 percent of donors gave
approximately 73 percent of all funds.^225 No wonder there is a close
correlation between the interests of the very rich and the policies
Congress makes law. Politicians argue they are not swayed by their
donors. But, when they are living and breathing the worldview of
this wealthy elite, and they are indebted to them for their position, it
becomes their worldview too.
A very tiny number of extraordinarily wealthy donors are gatekeepers,
choosing the candidates by bankrolling exorbitantly expensive
elections. In 2016 we had two presidential candidates who well over
half of American citizens did not like or respect. This is astonishing.
It reflects an achingly diseased democracy.

#### ELECTIONEERING

Election campaign coverage is about the sensational instead of what
an informed electorate needs to know. Investigative journalism and
critical editing is often replaced by repeated ideological sound bites or
_“Oh my!”_ memes with entertainment value.

For example, in the 2015 primary season, the Trump campaign got
333 minutes of free coverage – worth an estimated $3 billion – from
the mainstream media – more than double the 19 other candidates
from both parties combined. Only 32 minutes were devoted to
issue coverage, and the only issues covered were terrorism, LBGT,
foreign policy, immigration, policing, and a few minutes for the
Environmental Protection Agency (which the Republicans want to
disband). There was almost no coverage of trade, energy, healthcare,
climate change, ongoing wars, drugs, poverty, guns, infrastructure, or
deficits. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, who stuck to talking
about issues and policy, got 10 minutes of coverage. Eight years ago,
the network newscasts devoted 220 minutes to issues coverage.^226 In
2016, CBS CEO Les Moonves said about their over-the-top coverage
of Trump’s antics, “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn
good for CBS.” Trump was entertaining and good for ratings, and
consequently ad purchases and profits.^227

We made a consequential choice for a world leader on very little
information and based on entertainment value. We will pay a steep
price for this negligence.

### Corrupt public policy

Back in the 1960s, the wealthy figured out that if they used their
tax-avoidance family foundation revenue to fund think tanks, they
could structure them to follow a prescribed point of view: theirs.
These think tanks churn out policy papers justifying our current
monetary system, our wealth-transfer economic policies, and write
the laws that support their personal agendas and beliefs.

Just one organization, the American Legislative Exchange Council
(ALEC), well-funded by big corporations and the extraordinarily
rich, has an inordinate amount of power in crafting legislation. It
pays legislators all over the country to come to forums to craft bills
according to free market fundamentalism and limited government.
Some bills passed are word-for-word bills this organization crafted to
promote the interests of the money power.^228

The bills ALEC promotes show by limited government it means: those
with money should be free to make as much money as they possibly
can, exploit the health of their employees, communities and the
environment, without being encumbered by safety standards or rules
that might hamper profits. Their policies are firmly entrenched in
myths of free enterprise and the rational invisible hand of unfettered
economic activity. There appears to be little understanding of
interdependence, of a strong foundation of common wealth, or the
simple responsibility to do no harm to others. Their power is a cancer
on our legislative process.

In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in the Citizens United decision
_“ingratiation and access”_ were _“not corruption.”_ So, if you can afford
to make your Congressmen so grateful he gives you access any time
you want, this is no longer considered corrupting the democratic
process.^229 Think back to Jane Mayer’s book, _Dark Money,_ about that
40 percent of sitting judges, including several on the Supreme Court, who have attended re-education camp at a luxury resort paid for by
very wealthy ideologues who want to make their ideology the law of
the land.

### Apathy

We are rightfully discouraged. In the 2016 election 63 percent of the
voting age population went to the polls, and 58 percent voted for
president.^230 231 Almost 40 percent of eligible voters stayed home.
In midterm elections, less than 40 percent tend to vote. There is
a widespread sense our votes do not matter, so why bother. It’s
discouraging to know lobbyists and wealthy donors will override
our voices.

The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance
found that the US lags behind most of our peers when it comes
to voter turnout. We rank 31st among the 35 countries in the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While
Belgium leads with 89 percent turnout, the US has a long way to go
at 63 percent. We clearly have something to learn from others.^232

## Corrupt education

A group of diverse, informed and independent thinkers make the
best decisions when they aggregate their points of view. This is why
democratic decision-making, although far from perfect, is the best
way to make decisions. A well-informed populace is the bedrock of
democratic decision-making, so a good education and an effective
press corps are crucial. Our money system is working against this
bedrock of democracy.

### Control by a few

A few extraordinarily wealthy people influence and sometimes control
what is taught in our schools. In addition to the previously noted
examples of altered curriculum in business law, economics, and
monetary theory, Big Money works to control how we provide public
education right down into kindergarten.

For example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation spent more than
$3 billion since 1999 on educational reforms, including the national
roll-out of No Child Left Behind in 2002 and Common Core in 2009.^233 This gave the Gates an unhealthy amount of power in setting
    US education policy. The Gates Foundation likes standardization,
       data and metrics. Transferring interoperability ideas from web
       development, Gates promoted the _Common Core_ curriculum and
    testing, noting, _“When you add textbooks, supplements, and assessments_
    _together, you’re talking about a $9 billion market that’s wide open for_
    _innovation.”_ 234 The underlying assumption is that innovative teaching
    happens when someone can make money developing curriculums.

Finland is way ahead of this thinking. They choose only the
brightest as teachers and pay them well. They give them a lighter
load and three to six years with the same children, so that they can
individualize inspiring instruction. Good education focuses on
developing abiding curiosity and the tools to satisfy it. Good teachers
are well-trained guides. They relate well to children and can manage
groups of them. They can assess individual children’s needs. They
have full tool boxes of ideas to encourage children’s curiosity and
passion for learning. Great teachers have time to follow their own
curiosity as life-time learners, and to model this pursuit of learning.
Great teaching requires human interaction; at its core, it’s not about
standardized prescriptive curriculums and testing.

Asking teachers to focus on standardized skill sets so that their
students will get high test scores crushes the joy out of teaching and
learning. It breaks my heart when my grandchildren say they hate
school because it’s boring. And it is breaking our democracy when
less than 40 percent of our teachers are satisfied with their jobs.
Between 40 and 50 percent of them quit within five years.^235 As a
lifetime educator I know this does not need to be the case.

And, returning to the monetizing of education mentioned in Chapter
6.60, by focusing on marketable skill sets, Common Core deprives
children of the richness of our culture. David Coleman, one of the
developers of the Common Core curriculum said, _“It is rare in a
working environment that someone says, ‘Johnson, I need a market_ analysis by Friday, but before that, I need a compelling account of your
childhood.” He’s explaining why Common Core de-emphasizes
literature and relies on more informational texts – speeches, magazine
articles, government reports. This thinking completely misses the role
of great literature in developing our minds and hearts.^236
I read through J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books every couple of
years for the fun of it. They are a pleasant counterpoint to economic
tomes. I enjoy the world she creates, the characters and the complex
story. I was reading one of the larger volumes while waiting for my
car to be serviced this past year. Making conversation, the young
woman receptionist asked if I was really reading that big book. She
went on to say that she didn’t think she’d ever read a book, well,
maybe one when she was in elementary school. I was dumbfounded.
Given her age, she grew up with No Child Left Behind and Common
Core. No literature seems almost criminal.

These expensive, standardized, test-heavy, employment oriented
educational programs are a mistake that would not have been made
if the decision making was done by a diverse group of independent
thinkers – and included all the stakeholders, not just those absorbed
with money-making. I know many educators and every one of them
says both these programs have been a disaster, sucking the life and joy
out of teachers and students.

If we’re going to be smart about education policy, we want many
different people making educational decisions for the nation – not a
tiny group of elites.

Jay P. Greene, head of the Department of Education Reform at
the University of Arkansas, says the Gates Foundation’s overall
dominance in education policy has subtly muffled dissent. “Really
rich guys can come up with ideas that they think are great, but there is
a danger that everyone will tell them they’re great, even if they’re not,”
Greene said. This is profound. It is the reason why we do not want
any part of our nation ruled by an elite few.^237

## Corrupt media

The wealthiest Americans own the media, so they prescreen
your choices and manufacture your consent based on their own
worldviews.^238 Our collective state of misinformation is destroying us.

Today, there is so much information out there it should be easy to
have diverse, independent and quality information from journalists.
And exceptional journalism is there if you look for it. But front and
center on our publicly owned and leased airwaves, we have a media
mostly parroting the same talking points of its few owners. And,
they chase after a few titillating stories that bring in ad revenue. In
addition we have a sludge of misinformed, poorly edited, fact-check-
failing, illogical internet chatter, often generated by fake grassroots
organizations funded by and presenting propaganda from the money
power – or as we’re learning, from the Russians.^239

The airwaves and communication networks are common wealth. They
belong to all of us. Journalists and the media play such an important
role in democracy, the _First_ Amendment of our Constitution protects
the freedom of the press. But, a free press is only possible when the
press is diverse and independent. This common wealth is seriously
degraded and woefully failing to serve us. When we are not well
informed, we are easy to manipulate.

### No longer public trustees

We once believed that those who lease the national airwaves owe the
country a service. We required this media serve our democracy as well
as make profits. When the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) was founded in 1934, it viewed the stations to which it granted
licenses as public trustees – and required they make every reasonable
attempt to cover contrasting points of views. In 1949, this was
established as a policy called the _Fairness Doctrine._^240

As public service, the Commission required stations report on crucial
issues in their communities. For example, national media had to give equal time to all presidential candidates. Local stations had to
do the same for local candidates. If we were discussing going to war,
our national news media had to give both pro and con points of
view. Local media had to be present and available to warn of danger
or hazards.

However, under President Reagan, in 1981 the FCC deregulated the
content of our broadcast media as well as ownership limits at the
behest of wealthy media owners. The Fairness Doctrine was removed.
The removal was justified on the basis of a growing number of media
outlets, including privately owned cable networks; the challenge of
identifying fairness; and, the right of broadcasters to free speech.^241
They ignored the increasing monopolizing of ownership. In the name
of free speech for those with power and money, Reagan removed
citizens’ right to be adequately informed. Owners and advertisers
got the freedom of speech, citizens got to be manipulated freely and
irresponsibly by those who made making money their highest value.

### Monopoly, monoculture & manipulation

In the interest of serving our nation, we once limited the ownership
of our media; no owner could monopolize a market.^242 In the 1970s
no one could own a newspaper and a TV station in the same market,
nor a radio station and a TV station. This gave us an independence
and diversity of reporting and ideas that supported a more effective
democracy. President Reagan began deregulating and making the
monopoly we have today possible.

In 1981 Reagan doubled the number of TV stations a media company
could own to forty. By 1983, still at the beginning of the Reagan
administration, fifty media companies controlled 90 percent of our
news and media.

In 1996, President Clinton and a Republican Congress put the nail
in the coffin when he signed the Telecommunications Act (House &
Senate-Republican majorities). This law allowed further consolidation
and over the next fifteen years media ownership dropped to nine big
media giants.

This law removed the 40-station ownership cap on radio stations,
allowing Clear Channel Communications to balloon from owning
43 stations to owning 1200 stations in all 50 states, reaching more
than 110 million listeners every week and dominating the audience
in 100 out of 112 major markets. In some markets, Clear Channel
owned as many as eight radio stations. To make more money, single
owners create programming for their entire network at one time and
in one place, dropping in audio clips of a local newscaster, making it
appear the content is created and broadcast locally. It’s not. Someone
is putting on a set of tapes and running them. This is good for
efficiency and profits. But it is bad for the local communities, and
bad for decision-making at all levels of government. Ten years ago,
Clear Channel became fodder for predatory hedge fund capitalists,
but the consolidation remains.^243

By 2011, 90 percent of our media was controlled by just six
companies. Today, just five Big Corporations control 90 percent
of our media. Just 15 billionaires own America’s news media
companies.^244 According to the New York Times, testimony before
the House Judiciary Committee reports that “In 1983, 50 companies
owned 90 percent of the media consumed by Americans. By 2012, just six
companies ...controlled that 90 percent.” 245

Even our public broadcasting of national news is strained through the
perspective of a handful of people who are entrenched for decades in
Washington groupthink. In 2016, the federal budget for nationwide
public broadcasting was $445 million, roughly 0.02 percent of the
federal operating budget – this in a democratic republic, in which
informed citizens with diverse points of view are required for effective
government. Even that puny sum is under threat. President Trump
has removed their funding from his budget each year, but Congress
has kept it in at the same level.^246

Investment in a dispersed, nationwide network of public news-
gathering and journalism that meets a high standard of accuracy
would build our common wealth, instead of diminishing it. Facebook
and blogs cannot be the foundation for an informed electorate.

Research says we are falling into silos of information that confirm
our existing ideas and biases.^247 This will not lead to wisdom or
good choices.

#### MANIPULATION BY GASLIGHTING

While on the one hand we have our main stream media – the media
that most people get their news from – tending toward limited
ownership and monopoly, on the other hand, the internet presents
an enormous variety of viewpoints, and no one is obliged to be
a responsible journalist. Truth can be a rabbit hiding in a briar
patch. This freedom on the internet was one of the reasons given for
eliminating the standards and Fairness Doctrine for our broadcasters.

A venue with no standards presents a whole new set of problems.
Media manipulation is on steroids. It is easy for lies to be spread. It’s
easy for an agent with funds to buy the big internet players’ databases,
and with a relatively small amount of advertising dollars to have a
significant impact on our elections and public policy. Russia worked
this in our 2016 election and claims it was to put their thumb on the
scales for Trump. Our intelligence agencies concur.

Wired magazine reports the Trump campaign ran up to 175,000
variants of ads and social media stories _per day_ to find which were
most likely to hook viewers. They accessed vast data bases of behavior
and buying information to target their most likely supporters with
proven-manipulative stories and ads.^248 There was zero effort to
engage the electorate in thoughtful issue-based democratic decision-
making. And, it worked. He won.

We’re struggling to figure out how to protect our democracy and
our nation from a corrupt authoritarian, plutocratic rule over a
manipulated citizenry.

#### MANIPULATION – NEWS

The Reagan administration removed any requirements for news
programming. Back mid-century some of our main broadcast
networks refused advertising during their hour of news because they did not want the news tainted – an era with a very different ethic!^249
Today, the majority of our news programs cover an editorially limited
selection of topics and often include editorial commentary.

The Reagan administration removed limitations on the amount of
advertising. In 1958, you had to watch about 8 minutes of ads to see
52 minutes of programming. Today _hour-long_ programs run 40–44
minutes. You must watch about 20 minutes of ads.

#### MANIPULATION – BUY MORE

Our media is overwhelmingly about getting you to shop! High
levels of emotion anchor advertising and political messages. So
programming is a steady rumble of threats to personal safety, keeping
people anxious, fearful and xenophobic. Buy a drug. Buy a can of
mace. Buy an alarm system. Dark-skinned people are “infesting” our
cities. Buy a gun. Spend taxpayer money on a bigger military and lots of
bombs. Build a wall! High emotion and fear serves the money power
because it makes people easy to manipulate. The owners know this,
because the networks charge higher prices for ads that are broadcast
during moments of high emotion such as a football touchdown.^250

#### MANIPULATION – PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

Today the US is one of only two countries that allow direct to
consumer prescription drug advertising – because it hooks more
people on expensive drugs! Before 1985 we banned direct-to-
consumer drug advertising. In the 1960s, more than 90 percent of the
pharmaceutical companies’ advertising was aimed at doctors. By 1993
direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs was $166 million,
but growing exponentially.^251 In 2016 drug companies spent over $5.6
billion so we would see drugs as the answer to many ailments.^252 And
it works.

Spending on prescription medicines grows exponentially at a rate of
4 to 7 percent each year. It is expected to be a $600 billion market by

2021.^253 There is no positive correlation between increases in spending
    on prescription drugs and good health.


The biopharmaceutical sector accounts for about 5 percent of
our entire economy. The US may be the most drug dependent
nation on the planet – and not the healthiest. Not including any
institutionalized people, in the past 30 days, 47 percent of us took at
least one prescription drug. Twenty-two percent took at least three
or more prescription drugs, and 11 percent took five or more. That’s
almost half of our population popping some kind of prescription pills
this past month!^254

Our CDC found that between 1999 and 2014 antidepressant use rose
by 65 percent – almost double in five years! By 2014, one in eight of
us over 12 were taking antidepressants – 16.5 percent of women and
9 percent of men.^255 Recent research finds these drugs may do more
harm than good.^256 Pharmaceuticals are important, but is this the
right proportion of our energy and wealth going toward prescription
drugs? We should be paying attention to why one in eight of us
are clinically depressed, instead of making it a profit center.

#### MANIPULATION – CHILDREN’S TV

Prior to the 1980s we kept our children’s TV mostly free of consumer
advertising and brand loyalty building. Childhood was sacrosanct.
No more. In 1984, the Reagan administration removed limits on
advertising in children’s television. In the name of free speech for
advertisers looking for lifetime brand attachments, Reagan removed
the freedom of our children to watch TV without being manipulated
by the money power. When Congress passed a bill to reinstate some
limits in 1988, Reagan vetoed it.^257

In 2014, the average child saw about 25,600 commercials every year.^258
This is down from the 40,000 reported a few years earlier, as kids are
spending more time on streaming services that do not include ads.
Fast food, candy and cereal account for about half of all food ads seen
by kids. In the 1970s, before we inundated children’s TV with junk
advertising, 5 percent of US children were obese. Today, children are
programmed by advertising to want junk food, leading to the one of
the highest obesity rates in the world. By 2008, in just over 30 years,
we have tripled the number of obese children to nearly 20 percent.^259

We are conditioning and programming our children to be mindless
consumers instead of healthy, informed citizens.

## No truth

We are in a post-truth era, struggling with how to recreate the
foundation of common facts that are essential to any real problem-
solving.^260 I would argue it is a product of a money system that
requires a con at the foundation of society, creates a transfer of wealth
to a tiny few, and idolizes money and those who have it.

A PositiveMoney.org survey found that only 3 percent of respondents
knew how our money is created.^261 Most people do not understand
that when they deposit money in the bank, they hand over ownership
of their money, and get an IOU. Most people do not understand
that the value and stability of our money depends on the confidence
of the world in our common wealth’s strength. Most people have
been conned.

Our system demands consumer confidence. So, there can be no
significant challenges to either the status quo or the money and
financial systems. A challenge causes doubt. And, doubt causes a
drop in confidence. The money con is so dependent on consumer
confidence, the Consumer Confidence Index is one of the key
measures of the health of our economy. This creates a culture
of deceit.

When it’s necessary to listen to some bad news to make prudent
decisions, our media ducks and runs. When our politicians and
news media cannot tell us the truth, because the truth might cause a
catastrophic collapse of our economy, something is seriously wrong.
And, this culture of keeping the truth hidden has metastasized into a
terminal cancer on our society.

Our current president is taking this societal characteristic to
unprecedented heights. People are keeping online logs of the
thousands of lies Trump tells, from silly ones about crowd size and
his parents birthplaces, to serious ones about foreign policy and
the economy. It’s daily. Watch the news today, and fact check his
statements. Historical evidence says there will be at least several lies.^262

We cannot have anything resembling rule by the people when the
people are kept in the dark about what is going on, and manipulated
with sugar-coated stories or slimed sound bites to do the bidding of
those on Wall Street who profit most from the big con.
