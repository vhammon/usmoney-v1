### 5.45 The Duties of Our Central Bank

20 Well, the bankers didn’t exactly say that. But, they did acknowledge that the private
banks and the central banks are the money creators. While these new reports got a
lot right, monetary reforms have noted, they got some things wrong, too.

### 5.46 Who Creates New Money?: A Privileged Elite of Private Bankers

24 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. “Historical Timeline 1900–1919.”
<https://www.fdic.gov/about/history/timeline/1900-1919.html>

25 FRED. Economic Research; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “Commercial Banks in
the U.S. (Q4)1983 to (Q4)2017”
<https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USNUM>

NOTE: It’s taken me years to write this and I’ve updated information many times.
Some changes are stunning. The number of banks reported by the St. Louis FED
dropped 8 percent in just 2 years, from 5,309 in 2015 to 4,888 in 2017. The graph
is nearly a straight line down. That’s a rapid and exponential monopolization. (And,
The FDIC has slightly different numbers...4,918 institutions). <https://www5.fdic.gov/hsob/HSOBRpt.asp>

26 FRED: Economic Research; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “5-Bank Asset
Concentration for United States (1996–2015).” Updated August 30, 2017. [https://
fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DDOI06USA156NWDB#0](<https:// fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DDOI06USA156NWDB#0>)

NOTE: The Canadian Toronto-Dominion Bank has a subsidiary, TD Bank, a
Delaware Corporation, 100% owned by foreigners, that is the eighth largest bank
in the US, and 100% foreign owned. The Canadian bank, in its 2017 Financial
Statement (as filed on November 30, 2017) states it has assets of $1,278,995
million, and $75,190 million in total equity. This is an equity ratio of 5.9%.
[https://www.td.com/document/PDF/investor/2017/2017-Q4_Annual_Financial_Statements.pdf](https://www.td.com/document/PDF/investor/2017/2017-Q4Annual_FinancialStatements.pdf)

The Federal Reserve Statistical Release on large Commercial Banks, as of
September 30, 2017, lists TD Bank as the 8th largest bank in the US with $285,495
million in assets. Remember bank assets, less equity, are some form of IOU from the
public, that the bank exchanged for their own IOUs in the form of Federal Reserve
Notes (our money). This is the money creation process, and foreigners control this
chunk of it.

  NOTE: Taking the December 1914 and the December 2017, the growth rate is
  8.4 percent. I’ve also figured this using the actual financial reports for those years
  and come up with 7.8 percent. So, I’ve generally rounded to 8 percent.

  Stock and Debt Measures - H.6 Release.” Last updated: May 24, 2018. https://
  <http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm>

NOTE: Rounding to billions accounts for the apparent $1 billion discrepancy. The
      numbers are $13292.8 billion and $13,917.3 billion, which results in a $625 billion
      increase in the money supply. There are several measures of the money supply. M1,
      M2, and M3. These represent expanding definitions of what constitute money in
      the system.

  <https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/combinedfinstmt2017.pdf>

NOTE: From FDIC data: $16.2 trillion in bank assets multiplied by 11.24 percent
equity equals $1.8 trillion of the banks’ assets represent accumulated wealth. From
Fed data: $4.45 trillion in Fed assets multiplied by 0.92 percent equity equals
$41.39 billion. Combined Assets of $20.7 trillion, less equity of (banks)$1.82 trillion
and (Fed) $41.39 billion, equals roughly $18.6 trillion in the reported money supply.
