Our financial sector is primarily a male bastion. When I started
working on this book, no more than 5 percent of the people taking
risks in our financial markets were women. In 2018 Reuters reports
that women account for 12 to 15 percent of trading roles.<sup>104</sup> That’s
good news, but a long way to go to achieve balance. This imbalance
has an impact on the characteristics of our marketplace and our
culture; it amplifies the boom-bust cycle and its outcomes.

Stories told by insiders about the booms and meltdowns over the
past 100 years have a recurring theme: many trading halls echo a frat
house – drinking, drugs, ostentatious spending on glitz and women,
high levels of self-aggrandizing, and risk, enormous egos vying to
be the biggest and baddest. Investment houses routinely seek out
immature young men to run their trading desks. Leaders who burst
into angry tirades are admired. Cautionary voices are dismissed.<sup>105</sup>
This culture is prevalent in the halls of finance and has an impact
on our economy. As the failures of either Lehman Brothers or Bear
Stearns & Co. in 2008 demonstrate, even smaller players can take the
whole system down.<sup>106</sup> <sup>107</sup>

## Testosterone Cycle

Researchers have been studying irrational exuberance, risk-taking,
irrational pessimism, and risk-aversion. Researchers at the University
of Cambridge in England (and others) found testosterone levels are
tied to how much risk a man will take.^108

The hormone testosterone is associated with higher levels of
competitiveness, a higher willingness to circumvent rules and
challenge authority, and higher risk-taking. Winning elevates
testosterone levels. Losing lowers them. Even watching a team or
team member win or lose can have this same effect. This means if
85 percent of traders in the financial sector are men, or 85 percent of
leaders in any segment of society are men, society is vulnerable to
boom-bust, aggression-retraction cycles.

A high speed, high-risk money-creation bank or a financial trading
office with a big line of credit, unchecked, can lead to catastrophe.
And given our monetary system, it can take the economy down with
it. A trader makes a successful loan or trade and his testosterone goes
up. Each success makes him more likely to increase the risk he is
taking. In the early stage of a bubble, there will be successes for the
early players, encouraging greater participation. The loan officer is
rewarded for making loans – not on whether the loans are successfully
paid back several years down the line, but on how many and how
big he makes them. The bigger the loan, the bigger his commission,
and the more pumped the loan officer is to make riskier loans. The
amount of money created depends almost entirely on bankers’
confidence in their ability to make profits, which is influenced by
hormones.

This increase in the money supply inevitably blows up asset bubbles.
The speculators who are in early buy, sell and make great profits.
This success increases the level of testosterone, which leads to taking
greater and greater risk. Then as the bubble inevitably pops, the
bankers, their testosterone levels bottoming out, withdraw from
taking risks.

In California and Nevada in 2006 and 2007, nearly 40 percent of
new loans were called liar loans or NINJA (No Income, No Job, no
Assets), issued at an adjustable rate with low payments for a couple
years and then a radical jump in payments.^109 These loans, also called
_liar loans,_ were bundled into securities, stamped with high ratings
by our ratings agencies and then sold to unsuspecting investors by
Wall Street financiers. It is nearly incomprehensible that mortgage
companies were pumping out loans without any paperwork backing
up repayment plans, and rating agencies were giving bundles of them
a high-grade rating. It is a kind of insanity that is difficult to explain,
except by factoring in greed, male hormonal imbalance, and pack
behavior.

## Adolescence

Most of the Wall Street traders on the floor are young males –
deliberately recruited for their hunger to achieve great wealth – as
chronicled by Michael Lewis, Matt Taibbi, Suzanne McGee, Frank
Partnoy, William D. Cohan and others. The frontal brain lobes
do not fully develop until the mid 20s in males, and this is where
altruism and contextual thinking develop (thinking of others and
thinking of the big picture).^110

It serves bank owners to have high-risk, testosterone driven,
immature males at the trading and loan desks. They are more than
willing to skirt the law to make profits, and with frontal brain lobes
still undeveloped, they have no problem making suckers out of their
own clients.^111 Altruism, moral or ethical considerations do not
intrude or impede. Immature, they have few scruples about hurting
individuals or the economy. Living through this sensitive period for
frontal lobe development in this money culture appears to block
normal healthy development since the oldsters on Wall Street seem
oblivious to their harmful impact on people and the world economy,
too. Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs said after the crash in
2009, he’s just a banker _“doing God’s work.”_ 112

When financiers are in a good mood and have confidence in the
economy, they make lots of deals that generate fees and massive
incomes. In the early 2000s, big investment houses made deals with
individuals, with small towns and even countries that they knew
were a dangerous risk for these investors. But, hey, it made them
money. To them, it was of no concern that hundreds of thousands of
people would suffer when the deals predictably went sour. Goldman
Sachs reportedly made hundreds of millions in profits on elaborate
derivative deals that were a big contributor to the Greek debt crisis
in 2009.^113 In 2016 Greeks struggled to buy medicine and food and
CEO Lloyd Blankfein took home over $22 million in salary and his
company stock had jumped from $53/share to over $253. This is what
he calls _“God’s work.”_ 114

Adolescence for both genders is a time when we crave excitement,
adventure and novelty. As Robert M. Sapolsky notes in his book, _The
Trouble with Testosterone_ (1998), adolescence is willing to say,

_to hell with logic and sensible behavior, to hell with tradition and respecting
your elders, to hell with this drab little town, and to hell with that knot of fear
in your stomach. Curiosity, excitement, adventure – the hunger for novelty is
something fundamentally daft, rash, and enriching.115_

These are wonderful traits and deserve a substantial place in our
culture. However, when we make these characteristics the overriding
characteristics of our money system, our financial system, and our
culture follows along and pushes aside the balance of prudence,
conservation, caring about others and seeing the forest for the trees.
Like an out of control adolescent, we come to grief. Again. And again.

## Gender balance

Whether genetic or culturally induced, there are general differences
between the way men’s minds work and the way women’s minds
work; the outcomes that receive the highest priority, the way we
communicate, and the role that preserving personal power and
authority plays in addressing issues, are gender influenced. And
hormones matter.

Research finds collective intelligence rises with the number of women
in a group, and at least three women will shift a group to better
problem solving.^116 Even the military finds women in combat troops
increase group problem-solving skills (though they also increase
casualties).^117 Until we have a balance of genders at the highest level
of power, we will continue doing what we’re doing and getting what
we’re getting.

Some countries are ahead of us in recognizing the importance
of gender balance and require corporate boards and governing
institutions be at least 40 percent each gender.^118 In the US, there
is a growing understanding that gender balance in companies is
an indicator of a more profitable company. As authors, Jackie
VanderBrug and Joseph Quinlan explain in _GenderLens Investing: Uncovering Opportunities for Growth, Returns and Impact_ (2016),
paying attention to gender balance when investing in companies can
make you more money.^119

**There is a natural balance of men and women. Our money system
and the financial strategies that support it will be healthier when
the characteristics we think of as masculine and feminine are also
in balance.**
