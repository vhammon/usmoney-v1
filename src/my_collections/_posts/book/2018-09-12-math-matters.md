A money system designed for exponential growth cannot be sustained
and produces predictable undesirable outcomes. Understanding the
unbending mathematical reality of a pyramid scheme helps explain
why this is true. A pyramid scheme is any financial scheme that
requires an exponentially growing number of participants and pays
early-in participants with newcomers’ contributions.

Back in the 1920s an Italian con man, Charles Ponzi, developed a
scheme. He offered people a 50 percent return on their investment
in 45 days, or 100% in 90 days. He didn’t invest the money; he
simply paid returns out of money coming from new investors – while
spending lavishly on himself. If everyone waited the 90 days, this
meant as one person’s payout came due, he needed two new investors
to pay them out. This was unsustainable. There weren’t enough
investors on the planet to keep it going for long, and lots of people
lost their money. Charles Ponzi gave his name to a particular kind of
financial pyramid scheme. In 2008, a group of investors lost over $
billion to a Ponzi scheme run for over 40 years by Wall Street darling
Bernie Madoff, proving people are reluctant to learn from math and
from history – and he was a master con man.

Most people understand a pyramid scheme is bad, but people
continue to fall for these schemes. Why? It’s worth taking a little
closer look, because understanding the math and the motivations of a
pyramid scheme helps us understand our current money system and
why it remains in place.

In any exponential scheme, the math is an unbending reality: those
who jump in early benefit at the expense of those who follow, and
only a very small number benefit at the expense of the many. In
terms of our money system, this means those who have the privilege
of creating new money benefit at the expense of everyone else. (More
on that later.)

## Pyramids and ‘Circles of Giving’

When I was living in Hawaii I lost a friendship because of a pyramid
scheme. Someone had come to the Island with a scheme carefully
designed to suck in women. It was called a _Giving Circle._ An
invitational you-are-special-when-you-belong circle of women was
meeting every week to discuss their dreams, how to overcome their
_unconscious blocks to accepting wealth into their lives,_ how to give this
wonderful experience to others, and to empower one another.

The scheme had a well-written back story: The Circle had been
started by the wives of some professional athletes in Seattle, who,
blessed with wealth and the ability to help other women, wanted to
share their good fortune.

The Circle had four courses like a good meal – yum! Love those
food metaphors. The idea was that a $5,000 _gift_ brought you into
this loving circle of women friends around the table at the _appetizer_
course. You gave your $5,000 to someone who had arrived at _dessert._
When you brought two more people in under you who gave $5,000,
you moved to the _salad_ course. When each of those two people
brought in two more, you moved to the _main_ course. And when each
of those two brought in two more, you moved up to the sweet _dessert_
spot and had eight people coming in at appetizer giving you $5,
each, for a $40,000 total.

It was an illegal pyramid scheme pure and simple. But the
participants were told stories about women who used part of their
$40K windfall to help another woman get into the Circle, and many
were convinced this could make the geometric progression into a
circle. The Circle attracted people who hoped to get a high reward for
a low investment. And lest you think the women were the only dupes,
there was a parallel scheme with another theme going on at the same
time for the men.

In the scheme outlined above, the mathematical reality is that for one
person to get $40,000, eight people must pay in $5,000 each. Since you pay $5,000 to get in the game, you net $35,000 if you’re one of
the lucky ones. It only takes 15 total participants for the first person
to walk with their dessert. But for the eight people who each pay them
$5,000, 64 people will need to be brought in with $5,000 each. For
these 64 people to get the payout, 512 people must pay in. Remember
what an exponential curve looks like: it looks totally doable in the
early stages. However in roughly 30 levels, you would need more
people than we have on the planet to pay off any of the last rounds.

That’s it. That is the math. **For every person who walks away with
the payout, seven people must forfeit their money.** Those who
are in early may be able to get some or all of their money back, and
may even be winners too. But in the total scheme, only one in eight
people can be a winner. That’s the simple mathematical reality.

My guess is these schemes get started by thoroughly unscrupulous
people. The con artists set themselves up with fake bank accounts to
fill the top three layers of a pyramid, giving each identity a creative
backstory...a widowed single mom struggling to pay her college
tuition, so she can better the lives of her children...a veteran just
starting up a business. Helping others is good, and we all want to be
helpful, right? These stories make participants feel good about joining
in, even if there are little red flags waving in the back of their minds.

The con artists pick a community and spend time at the social centers
(coffee shops, churches, etc.) to pick out the vulnerable social leaders.
They find social networkers who are hungry for quick money. They
fill the first group of eight participants by taking a little time to get to
know them and then let them in on this _incredible opportunity_ to _give
and to receive._ This first round of eight will pay $5,000 to the _dessert_
top position, which is one of the con artists using an alternate ID.
Now they’ve got eight social networkers with an interest in talking 16
more people into participating, and then 32 more people.

The con artists have taken the seven positions in the top three levels.
Each position will earn them $40,000 if they can keep the scam going
until all these positions reach _dessert_ and get paid out. The con artists
are not contributing anything to anyone, so all their income is profit.
Up through this point, if the pyramid developed evenly (every entry at each level finds its two new participants), all the money coming in
would go to the creators of the scam in their various IDs. If any of
the people below them manage to fill the positions under them – two
people, who get two more people, who get two more people – and
get a payout it serves to fire up everyone else: _“Hey, this works!”_ The
successful early-in players will prove it all works, and will stand as
beacons to draw the rest of the moths into the flame.
Once the con artists collect from the top positions, they fade into
the sunset with $280,000, leaving the community to the inevitable
collapse of the pyramid and the ensuing ill will.

I did my best to point out to a friend that according to the laws
of math, out of every eight people who play the game, only one
can walk away successful – at the expense of seven other people. It
is simply not a circle. Even if every single person who succeeded
jumped back in the game with $5K of their $40K take, it would just
stretch out the number of levels until the collapse. She accused
me of being close-minded, stuck in a poverty consciousness, an
obstructionist, and stopped speaking to me. Sigh.

I heard one lovely-spirited woman got in very early and made it to
the $40,000 payout. I moved away before the scheme had run its
course, and I’ve wondered since how many of the people who paid
her got anything back, and how that affected community spirit and
her place in the community. Maybe not at all, as people are often
willing to say, _“It was my fault; I didn’t work hard enough to bring in
more people under me.”_ Or, in hindsight, they say, _“Wow! I was sure a
sucker, so it’s my own fault.”_

With a Ponzi scheme, we see our own effort and not the system that
drives the outcome. We also see those who succeed or fail and credit
their effort, rather than the system.

It is just so with a money system.

## Some win, most lose

In any pyramid scheme there are three types of players: the con artists,
the successful participants, and the vast majority who lose their shirts.
That should sound familiar to anyone studying our current economic
conditions.

However, human existence isn’t a neat and simple math problem.
Let’s say my friend who succeeded with an extra $35,000 in her
pocket used her new money to start up a business providing a
wonderful widget that bettered the lives of many. Say her business
became a great market success, requiring more employees and
increasing the tax base in her community. Over time, the $35,
she took from others created millions of dollars in benefits to the
community. Would that make it right?

How could we decide whether the $5,000 loss to the people who
funded her windfall and investment was worth the price? It would
have an entirely different flavor, wouldn’t it, if the seven people
contributed their $5,000 as investors themselves? They would be
apprised of the risk and would share in the profits of her enterprise
should it succeed. The con gives her success a bad taste; it makes any
success that follows rotten at the core, and creates a culture where if it
makes money, it’s OK. Does that sound familiar?

Clearly, the losers will see the answer to the worth it question
differently, too. Perhaps the loss of $5,000 meant a mom went
without the medical care she needed and died, leaving her motherless
children dependent on the State – at a cost of millions to the
community.

## Financial pyramids

Finance is an aspect of our living economy. It is subject to the
limitations of any living system, including a finite pool of participants
and resources. This means any financial scheme or money system that
requires exponentially expanding the supply of participants, money,
profits or resources is ultimately doomed to collapse. That is the math and the real world. Keep this crucial understanding in mind as we
look at money systems.

Next we’ll talk about why we are so vulnerable to the call of a con.
