What is the impact of having a money system that constantly cycles
between economic boom and bust? It unbalances the marketplace,
making prices more volatile and speculation more prevalent. The
privileged have the power and wealth to first rig, then own the
marketplace. And when you own it, it works to your advantage to
turn it from industry to a casino. You make more on the gambling in
a rigged casino than on the sales at the lunch counter or the gift shop.
Does this sound like our economy today?

Hedge fund managers who wheel and deal make some of the highest
incomes ever. But, they contribute little of value. In 2016, the top
two hedge fund managers each took home $1.5 billion – up from
$1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in 2014.^120 That’s a 50 percent increase
in income in two years and it should tell you where we are on the
exponential curve of money creation. Together the two of them could
pay for the entire budget of San Jose, or San Diego, or Austin, or
Dallas, or Detroit, or Boston or Charlotte.^121

## A value taken to extreme

Traders who are intermediaries between real sellers and real buyers
provide a service. For example, a distributor who gathers eggs from
many farmers and brings them to local grocery stores provides
a service.

In contrast, speculators buy and sell only to make a profit; they do
not take possession of a good or service and use it or add value. A few
speculators who buy and sell just for the game of profit extraction,
expand the number of buyers and sellers in a marketplace. This is
a boon to sellers; more people competing to purchase their goods
means they get a better price. However, it is a burden on genuine
buyers, as they must pay more.

When speculators overwhelm a marketplace, they run the price of
goods up as they extract profit buying and selling amongst themselves.
The final buyers who actually take possession pay significantly more
than they would have paid had they been competing with only other
genuine buyers. For example, the gallon of gas you buy, has been
bought and sold hundreds and thousands of times by speculators
ratcheting up the price a micro-penny at a time as they take a profit.
In the 1960s a stock was held for eight years on average.^122 By 2014,
the average length of time was in the seconds for at least 85 percent
of the trades. Some trades hinged on microseconds between buy
and sell.^123
When a real buyer, who wants to take possession of some crude oil
steps up to the plate, estimates say from 30–60 percent of the price
they pay went to gamers in the financial sector.^124

This is true for all the commodities that trade in a public marketplace
where gamers are allowed and unfettered. Consequently, you
pay more for everything you buy. This is a burden on the whole
world. As recently as 1975 roughly 80 percent of foreign exchange
transactions involved the real trading of a product or service. By 2011
the Global Policy Forum could only trace 0.6 percent to genuine
international trade in goods and services. On world market exchanges - commodities, stocks, currencies – well over 90 percent of the trades
    are now made by speculators.^125

On our stock markets, at least 85 percent of the trades are made
by high-speed speculators who hold the stocks for micro seconds,
leveraging their high data transmission speed so they see who is
intending to buy, beat them to the purchase, add a sliver of profit
and sell immediately. It’s difficult to know, but some estimate there
is a high-speed trader on at least one side of every single trade in our
markets. By making millions of these trades, adept traders take home
billion dollar incomes. Their incomes come out of the nation’s pocket,
as they raise the price of everything. This raises the prices of stocks,
too, which is a boon to investors, including the retirement accounts
of many. But, the increase is unrelated to an actual increase in the
value of a company, and it is vulnerable to the next bust.

Michael Lewis’s book, Flash Boys (2014), offers a jaw-dropping
glimpse into this world. These traders are skimming cream off the top
of the entire economy, making everything we buy cost more.^126

Our current financial system allows the wealthiest people in the
financial sector to buy and sell without putting up much money
of their own and without taking possession of the goods. There are
some limitations on the leverage players can exercise, which are
most stringent on smaller players. The closer you are to the center of
action and the bigger the player, limitations on leverage dwindle to
practically nothing.

When you don’t have much skin in the game, speculation becomes
the rule, rather than the exception. And, this is how our marketplace
operates today.

## A culture of gambling

When there is more money to be made playing the game rather than
making a real contribution to society, the culture changes. A culture
of speculation has eaten away at our responsibility to the common
wealth and to our own futures. We once believed gambling was either
a sin or an acceptable entertainment in moderation. Lotteries were
common in the 18–19th centuries in the US and often used in lieu
of taxes for public works. But, seldom regulated, corruption was
common, and by 1900 lotteries were mostly banned.

In the 1960s – the beginning of the steeper slope of our exponential
curve of money creation – state government debt increases meant
more tax revenues were going toward interest payments and less
was available for services. State governments sought other funding
sources, and lotteries seemed an easy, no-additional-taxes choice.
Now we accept lotteries are necessary to adequately fund our schools
and other basic services. In 2016, 44 states and territories offered
government operated lotteries.^127

In 2017, Americans spent $74 billion on lottery tickets. This is more
than the total spending on music, books, sports teams, movies and
video games combined, according to CNN Money.^128 That’s a lot of
money not being saved for retirement or used to pay off credit card
debt or used to buy better food, safer housing or education.

According to Reuters, _“the 44 states with lotteries (plus the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico) get 44 cents from this form of gambling for
each dollar of state corporate income tax.”_ At last count, there were 11
states in which lottery revenues exceeded revenues from corporate
taxes. And most lottery gamblers are poor. My home state of Oregon
is one of three states that draws more than 5 percent of its revenue
from gambling. Collecting revenue for commonwealth services by
suckering mostly the poor into gambling is deeply troubling.^129

**We can do better.**
