Debt creates our money and the supply must expand, so debt must
increase. To make this growth possible, bankers can create as much
money as the number of available borrowers allows.

Remember the exponential curve of our money supply growth for the
past 100 years presented in [Chapter 2.7.](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-2/section-7) As we moved up the steep
end of the curve’s slope – the last years of the 20th century – to create
an exponentially growing supply of money, bankers had to come up
with new borrowers.

## No savings to borrow

For individuals, savings are good. When people save for their future,
savings get them through emergencies, or they can lend or invest.
But, banks do not need savings to create new money. And when they
use savings for their lending they must pay a percentage to the saver,
which cuts into their profits.

Our system does not support or encourage personal savings. So the
amount of money people save has been slowly shrinking. The Federal
Reserve reports that our _“Net saving as a percentage of gross national
income”_ has dropped from averaging about 11 percent in the 1960s to
1980s to averages below 3 percent since 2000. The rate in January 2018
is 1.5 percent.<sup>1</sup> In fact, we recorded negative saving rates from 2008
to 2011, which means people were taking more out of savings than
putting in. Some of this is due to retiring boomers drawing on their
savings, but given the numbers, there should be a balance of young
savers and there isn’t. (Increasing student debt is a factor.)

Big businesses have been doing the same. Corporations spend
more buying their own stock than they save and invest in capital
improvements. Buying back stock juices its value, so the business
has greater borrowing power and CEOs can collect higher salaries.
The New York Post reports that from 2008 to 2016, US companies
spent $4 trillion buying back their own stock. In 2016, _“a whopping
66 percent of corporate earnings went to buybacks.”_ 2

The dearth of long-term investment ultimately hollows out business.
When individuals and businesses have no savings upon which to
draw for big investments or to cover unforeseen calamities, they must
borrow. Some businesses even borrow to buy back their stock. Since
the system demands increasing amounts of borrowing, the bankers
are happy.

## More borrowers – Home loans

In 1900 America, the 46 percent who owned their homes generally
owned them outright. Today, while we are above 60 percent home
_ownership,_ only about 30 percent of home owners actually own their
home mortgage free.<sup>3</sup> That represents a substantial increase in the
amount of debt against homes. Creating new money by making a
mortgage loan against real property has always been a favorite of
bankers. They legally own the property until the loan is paid, so they
have a solid backup should the borrower default.

After the Great Depression, when many defaulted on mortgages,
bankers refused to refinance or issue new loans. A shrinking
money supply was hurting the economy, so the federal government
established institutions, such as the Federal National Mortgage
Association, or Fannie Mae, that gave bankers a greater measure
of confidence in issuing mortgage loans – and shifted some of the
banks’ risks onto the commonwealth. Mortgage loans resumed a
steady exponential increase. After WWII, provisions in the G.I. Bill
guaranteed loans to veterans giving banks confidence to issue even
more mortgages. By 2017, total mortgage debt in the US was $
trillion – about $118,000 for every US household.<sup>4</sup> But, there are
only so many people who need to buy a home, and most of us get by
with one.

## More borrowers – Consumers

Until the 1940s there was almost no consumer debt – the slow and
low part of the exponential curve of our expanding money supply.
Most families saved to buy what they needed. It was common for a
family to have an account – a line of credit with a local store, which
they settled every month. This debt to the store was not monetized; it
could not be used by the community.

To satisfy the demand of private money creation, more people had to
become _bank_ borrowers. While in the early part of the century people
would have saved for a car or a big appliance, by the mid 1950s
it was becoming easier for consumers to take out a loan for these
purchases. When the auto and large appliance borrower pool became
saturated, banks came up with the idea of bank issued cards that gave
people the ability to have revolving credit for any and all purchases.
(Revolving means you pay it back and take it out again, though many
people carry their balance and just pay the interest.) Prior to 1968, the
Fed records no revolving credit.

Before 1974, it was hard for women to get credit. The _1974 Equal
Credit Opportunity Act_ required banks to consider women’s
applications for credit using equal standards. This doubled the pool
of potential borrowers.

At the end of 2017, revolving debt, mostly credit card balances, was
$1 trillion – about $8,099 for every adult in the US. Non-revolving
credit is another $2.8 trillion – another $22,080 per adult. This means
in addition to the average household mortgage burden of $118,232,
American adults carry an average of $30,200 each – roughly $150,
or more per household.<sup>5</sup>

In 2017 median _household_ income was roughly $58,000.<sup>6</sup> So in
about 50 years, from 1970 to 2017, American households went from
having almost no consumer debt to owing more than twice what
they earn in a year. With an average interest rate of 5 percent, the
median family dedicates roughly $7,400, or 13 percent of its gross
income to pay interest on its debt. For families without a low interest
mortgage, the interest on their debt is considerably higher – often
above 20 percent for credit card debt. Diverting 13 percent of one’s
income to pay for interest means there is less to spend – and an even
greater need to borrow. Quite a feast for the bankers! And this is just
ordinary debt; over 12 million Americans borrow from payday lenders
that charge up to 400 percent annual interest, costing poor families
billions of dollars.

There is a limit to how much debt people can carry, and in my
opinion, we are likely over the limit.

## More borrowers – Business

Prior to 1950, most debt was incurred by people of great wealth for
big business investments – the wealthy and well connected borrowing
from banker friends. It was rare for small businesses to go into debt;
they used profits to reinvest in expansion and equipment. Businesses
often had credit lines with their suppliers, or agreements to pay their
bills in 30, 60 or 90 days, or more – which is a kind of borrowing.
However, they were not borrowing from banks, who would be
creating new money by the lending. And, their debt to their supplier
was not monetized – it could not be used by anyone else in the
community.

The Main Street business attitude toward borrowing changed over
time. Small business owners are often on a treadmill of debt. A 2016
Experian study of 2.5 million small business owners found that the
small business owner has an average mortgage balance of $192,000,
an average credit limit of $56,100 and an average income of $91,600.
That’s a challenging level of debt to carry. The inescapable interest
payments on previous debt can make it impossible to withstand a
downturn in sales and necessitate further borrowing.<sup>7</sup>

## More borrowers – Other nations

Prior to the 1970s American banks made their loans almost
exclusively to American businesses and individuals. But the money
supply growth curve was heading up, and there were not enough
American businesses and individuals to absorb all the new money
creation needed to satisfy the exponential growth imperative. A
whole new market for loans was born.

In the 1970s and early 1980s there was a boom in lending to other
nations – even governments on the brink of collapse. Often the
collapse was part of the plan, with the other nation’s natural resources
becoming collateral booty for the bankers. Bankers paid consultants to dream up expensive development schemes, like big dams and
electrical plants for countries with no wire network to carry the
electricity from the plant to the populace. These loans often required
the borrower countries to spend the loans on buying American-
made goods and services. This did triple duty: increased the supply
of money as the system required by issuing more and bigger loans;
increased the economic output of American business; and, put
developing countries and their natural resources under American
corporate thumbs. John Perkins book, _Confessions of an Economic
Hitman_ (2004) or S.C. Gwynne’s _Selling Money; a Young Banker’s
First-hand Account of the Rise and Extraordinary Fall of the Great
International Lending Boom_ (1986) explain this immoral and shameful
activity in detail.8 9

## More borrowers – Students

Prior to 1984, students received more grants than loans. As a nation,
we once believed support for intellectual curiosity and a liberal
arts education was good for the nation as a whole; we believed in
an educated citizenry. A significant shift happened under Ronald
Reagan, who as governor of California said the state had no business
_“subsidizing intellectual curiosity”_ – a strange attitude for a leader in a
democracy.<sup>10</sup> But it is an attitude that makes short-sighted sense if
the goal is to strengthen the money power and manipulate a poorly
educated populace. A few years later as president, Reagan initiated
a national shift away from grants for education to student loans – a
new candy jar for Wall Street bankers.<sup>11</sup>

Before the Reagan administration there was almost no student debt.
In 2006, the Fed records $481 billion in student debt. Twelve years
later in 2018, the debt had tripled to $1,521 billion. 2005 marks a
dramatic change in the rate of debt increase. The 2005 Bankruptcy
Reform Bill made an exception of student debt. It is the only debt
that cannot be discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding. This reduces
the risk for those who create money to loan to students.<sup>12</sup>

Roughly 44 million of our 160 million working age adults carry an average of $37,172 in student loan debt. Of those, 5 million are in
default – their job prospects have not been enough to enable them
to repay their debt. Being in default on a loan is crippling and most
student loans cannot be discharged by a declaration of bankruptcy.
Over 3 percent of our working age adults are so encumbered – and
the number is growing.<sup>13</sup>

## More borrowing – US Government

The US Government debt in dollars forms a slightly lagging, tandem
curve with the money supply. This has two benefits for the money
system: it is a trustworthy anchor; and with a depreciating dollar,
more money is needed for government operations, or government
operations must be cut, which means more borrowing nationwide.

The more government borrows, the bigger its interest payments and
the more it must borrow. In 2017, interest payments gobbled up
18 percent of all the Operating Fund revenue.

To maintain the same level of government service, government
must collect more to make up for the 18 percent going to interest
payments. And this is in addition to the steady 3–8 percent increase
needed to hold even given the deliberate loss of a dollar’s value. More
tax collection means less money to spend in the private sector. Less
money to spend means more borrowing. The money creators do well
until the people and the commonwealth are bankrupt.

## More borrowing – Wall Street on margin

Wall Street has another world of eager borrowers – themselves.
Bankers have always lent to their friends and cronies whenever they
could get away with it. However, these kinds of loans predictably lead
to a high incidence of bank failure. _The Glass-Steagal Act_ was passed
in 1933 to reduce this danger by banning banks with money creation
powers from investing on their own behalf with newly created money.
But the _Financial Services Modernization Act_ in 2000 did away
with the wall between money creation and investment. After the
predictable meltdown, the _Dodd-Frank Act_ of 2010 stuck a few fingers in the dam, but did little to genuinely curb Wall Street excesses. Six
years later, the banks are bigger and more consolidated than ever and
raking in the profits at our economy’s expense.

In addition to skimming off the top in plain sight, Wall Street has
enormous private stock trading platforms, operated mostly by
brokerages, called _dark pools._ These private exchanges for trading
securities are inaccessible to the general investing public and have
a complete lack of transparency. According to the SEC, in 2005
these pools accounted for roughly 5 percent of national market
system trades. By 2015, they were executing about 18 percent, in
fact executing a larger portion of consolidated volume than smaller
exchanges.<sup>14</sup> Here borrowing and gaming take place mostly off the
books. Banks trade with each other and with well-chosen marks –
often with borrowed funds. Given the exponential curve of money
supply growth, the dark pools today must be soaking up a greater and
greater percent of money creation activity.

Borrowing is not necessarily a bad thing. We enjoy owning things
we could not have if we had to save up to buy them. Again, it is a
matter of balance, and it is a matter of where the borrowed money
comes from – a system choice. Without a system change, we can’t
keep climbing the exponential curve safely. But, the system requires
continued exponential growth of a money supply created by issuing
debt. How can the system continue to function?
