A stable value common wealth money is a neutral tool; it does not
benefit or privilege anyone. For this reason, we will have a marketplace
that comes closer to the ideals of a free market. Prices in our marketplace reflect true cost. The diversity of options increases. Manipulation
that eliminates independent choice decreases. Informed consumers are
more free to choose.

There is a balance of power between business owners and employees.
Business owners still reap rewards for their efforts _and_ employees are
in a position to avoid slow-death wages or work conditions. Greedy
immoral profiteers are replaced by responsible owners. While the price
of labor may increase, this will increase the amount of money circulating in local economies which will have a broad positive impact.

Changing the money system does not change the economic system.
We will still have private ownership of business and competition. With
increased market diversity and prosperity, we are likely to have more.
Without the interference of a few manipulating our money, we will
have a level playing field and fewer monopolies. We will be a country
genuinely offering an opportunity for everyone to get ahead with some
hard work. Entrepreneurs with a good idea will have a broader base of
people with capital to invest. More people will have the savings to take
part in campaigns like those on Kickstarter.

It will no longer be possible to lose your money through no fault of
your own. Your money will no longer be vulnerable to either bankers’
hormonal levels and moods or market euphoria. You will personally have
to make choices that lose your money; no one else will be able to lose it
for you without your permission. Prosperity will be a genuinely available
choice for everyone. This is what a free market is supposed to be about!

## Freedom & Structure

With common wealth money, we do not need to make a cost-benefit
analysis that prioritizes profit-making. If a product kills people either
quickly or slowly, you can’t do it. If it’s not safe according to available
information – and it’s a business’s obligation to check – then go back to
the drawing board, create a safety protocol that protects life, or BOLDLY
label it with full information on the risks. And, if safety makes it more
expensive and people do not want to pay the higher price, or it is too
risky, and not enough customers want to take the risk, then you do not
have a product to sell. If you can’t come up with a safe plan, then find
another business. When we are not driven to keep growing the economy, we can say no to products and services that pose a risk to either our
health or the environment. There will no longer be a systemic mandate
to exploit and harm each other in the name of a prosperous economy.

## A real free market

We are only free when we are informed and protected from exploitation. Government sets the standards and rules that assure a level and
safe playing field. **A free market is possible. And government only
has this power to set the necessary standards and protections when
it has the power to create a nation’s money.**
