Two new currency variations are emerging; they’re both called digital
currency, and they’re very different. One will rule us, one will serve
us. Nearly all of money today is created and used online. So, most of
our money is already digital. However, the term, digital currency, is
recently being used in two different ways. In each use it describes a
money system that eliminates cash, and takes advantage of emerging
cryptocurrency technologies [(Chapter 4.39).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-4/section-39) Value still references
a national currency, for now. The term is used to describe two very
different money systems.

## BIG BOX MONEY – ONE BIG BANK IN ONE BIG MARKETPLACE

Our current money system puts the power of money creation in the
hands of the private banks and gives them a monopoly on creating
our national money, served by a central bank, and guaranteed by
the common wealth of the nation. This system faces rapidly rising
competition from private marketplace corporations that are calling
their new money, digital currency. In this new iteration of privately
created money, private broad spectrum marketplace corporations
create the money supply, unregulated as bankers. They serve as their
own central bank, facilitating all transfers. They are creating money
by issuing loans and credit. They’ve already begun. They are taking
the power to create new money for the commons, which will give
them enormous control over society and the marketplace.

In a cross fertilization, just as our central bank decided it can create
money directly for corporate businesses [(Chapter 5.53),](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-5/section-53) corporate
businesses decided they can act as banks, currently with little
oversight. Businesses offering credit to their customers is not
new. But, up until recently, the credit that a business offered to its
customers was not monetized; it could not be used by others to buy
and sell. That has changed, pioneered by a couple very large Chinese
companies. This is an expansion of the money creation power, made
possible by huge monopolized digital marketplace platforms. These
corporations use the same money system (no reserve, little equity,
IOU-future-value money). The difference is in who has the power to
create new money, how it is distributed, and whether society sets any
standards, rules, or regulations on this power.

### This is a significant change

Big corporations are becoming digital currency bankers, intending
to provide both basic banking services and money supply creation to
their pools of customers.

### An important distinction

As explained in [Chapter 3.25](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-3/section-25) and [3.26,](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-3/section-26) basic banking services and
money creation are two distinct functions. Basic banking service is
a business and a free enterprise system can determine the dominant
players. Money creation controls and rules economies and hence
society as a whole.

#### BASIC BANKING

Many banks compete to hold and transfer our money – to serve
as our basic banker. Technology makes this simpler, and expands
the service beyond banks. China leads the way in streamlining the
transfer of money and cutting the costs of transfer. In 2004, Alibaba
Group Holding Ltd. created Alipay for customers who did not have
credit or debit cards. Tencent Holdings Ltd. introduced a similar
payment system in 2005 for its WeChat customers. In the US, these
services are similar to PayPal or Apple Wallet. But, the Chinese
companies have removed the intermediating bank credit or debit card.
It is more comparable to Amazon becoming the marketplace AND
the banker, which is the direction it is heading. By 2018, these two
Chinese companies together had 1.5 billion active users who spent
over $2.9 trillion using their systems. Their basic banking transfer
services cost roughly half what we pay in the US. Their efficiency is
threatening the US and global bankers who take $2.75 out of a typical
$100 credit card purchase in the US, and make about $3 billion in
bank fees.<sup>66</sup>

[Chapter 3.25](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-3/section-25) noted that if the world were one big bank, all the bank
would need to do is make a data entry that moved money from one
account to another. There would be no need for settlement between
banks. That is essentially what these big private corporate entities are
doing; they are becoming the One Big Bank in One Big Marketplace.
If everyone exchanging money is on their platform – buying, selling,
and transferring money between each other – all marketplace
exchanges are simply a matter of a data entry on the corporation’s
platform.

#### MONEY CREATION

These private corporate platforms are not limiting themselves to basic
bank services. They are rapidly moving into the territory of money-
creator banks, creating their own loan services using the same model
of money creation that all private banks use in our current money
system. This ability to pick and choose who gets newly created money
gives them enormous additional power over society.

The success of these Chinese platforms has western global bankers
in a bit of a panic, scrambling to duplicate their success before the
Chinese platforms successfully establish footholds and the prime
position in Western countries as well.

It is extremely important to keep in mind that when we conflate
basic banking and money supply creation, and assume banking
means both, we hand off the power to rule to those who have the
greatest market dominance and power. We focus on their creation of
efficiencies in the transfer of funds in the marketplace, and fail to give
due import to their creation of the money supply itself.

Big global corporations have become broad spectrum monopolies. In
the US, Amazon already comes close to dictating what retailers can
charge, by demanding the ability to purchase at a wholesale price
that enables them to undercut competition.<sup>67</sup> I would guess AliBaba
does the same. Imagine a world where a few corporations control
and take a cut from suppliers, buyers, sellers, people transferring
money, AND, have the power to create the money supply. These few corporations would control the direction and conditions of the
economy and society.

As these big private corporations take the power to create the money
supply, which is the power to rule, we face a crucial choice and
decision. We can accept that those with the biggest commercial
platform will rule society. Please read Chapter 6 as a cautionary tale
about this choice. Or, through our government we can institute
standards, rules, and regulations that protect the common wealth
from the predations of a few business entities that act to make
more money for a few owners. Or, we can assure that the creation
of our money supply becomes a public utility, in service to all.
[(Chapters 8 – 10)](https://usmoney.us/book/)

The transfer efficiencies of blockchain technology in a digital currency
have not been lost on central banks. They are exploring how this
model can be adapted to their basic banking and the money creation
power. Most are not considering a change in the money system; they
are considering a change in technology.

## COMMONWEALTH DIGITAL CURRENCY

A very different money system is also using the term, digital currency.
Some monetary reformers who advocate a commonwealth money
system – a 100% sovereign equity money system – see great possibility
in melding this new technology with a government-created,
democratically issued, national currency.

A monetary reform group in the Netherlands, OnsGeld, and other
global monetary reformers, including some within the Bank of
England, are inspired by the possibilities of Blockchain technology
to increase privacy, reduce transfer costs, and eliminate the need for
commercial and central banks. They advocating a system change
using this digital, blockchain technology. They are calling this
a digital currency system. This is a very different meaning than
that meant by corporate marketplaces. Clarify before you use the
expression.

A privately owned, corporate IOU-future-value money system with
money creation powers will rule. A commonwealth money system
can serve the economy.
