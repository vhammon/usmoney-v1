## The US economy

Our money system is going to collapse and take the economy with
it. That is the system. The downturn is past due. We’re heading off
the chart of the exponential curve of debt and money creation. Over
the ten years from 2006 to 2016, our central Fed expanded its balance
sheet by 18 percent on average every year. There’s an end to this road
and it’s coming up fast.

Our monetary wizards are out of ammunition to manage the next
meltdown. It will be too big. But, they’re inside and either don’t see
it coming, or figure they’ll have the power and privilege to come out
making a profit – even if the national economy collapses. And, some
of them will because they have power and privilege and will look out
for themselves.

Did the system pressure us to elect a billionaire president who will
give Wall Street and the radical generals a free hand because the
system requires freer money creation and more war to keep them in
business? With all three branches of government in their power, the
GOP has been very busy deregulating the financial industry as much
as they can. These changes will further destabilize our economy, ramp
up the transfer of wealth to billionaires, and erode the common
wealth – amplifying the size of the bust.

After the election financiers were giddy in their expectations of a self-
benefitting boom – as evidenced by the skyrocketing shares of the
biggest banks. Within one month of the election of billionaire Trump,
bank stocks gained 20 percent.<sup>286</sup> As finance is deregulated, the value
of the stock market reached an unhealthy and giddy size of 26,617 at
closing in January 26, 2018. But by Summer 2018, the cracks, mini-
gyrations, and initial scattered drops that characterize the closing to a
crash had begun.<sup>287</sup>

On election Trump baldly stated that for his cabinet secretaries: _“I
want people that made a fortune!”_ Money-making is his measure. Trump’s first 17 picks for cabinet and cabinet level posts had a
combined net worth of more than $9.5 billion – more than a third
of American households combined.<sup>288</sup> Experience in the cabinet’s
portfolio of responsibilities, experience managing staffs in the tens
of thousands, experience working with Congress...in other words,
competence, was ignored in his cabinet picks. Money-acquisition
was all that mattered to be on his team. These people are the top
10 percent of the top 10 percent – the ones with money creation
power. There is no evidence that they are worthy of our trust or that
they will care for the general welfare and domestic tranquility over
their own profit-making. Eighteen months into this administration, it
feels like the road to the end has become a fast track.

## Global money system

International banking follows the same formula that the global
banks model in the US, with slight national differences. The global
banks hold reserves, and currently a majority are in US dollars. This
is money held in banks around the world to anchor the creation
of national and global money. To keep using our money as a cash
standard and reserve, **the world must believe our economy is strong
and our nation well led.**

### Reserve Currency

Global and national banks are nearly all fractional reserve systems,
committed to maintaining some level of reserves or equity, or at
least pretending to on their books. Globally, as in the US, the ratio
of reserves to total money supplies has been shrinking. In the first
half of the 20th century, British Sterling was the most used reserve
currency, sharing that status with the US dollar, French franc and the
German mark. After WWII, the Bretton Woods agreements made the
US dollar the primary world reserve currency with a guarantee from
the US government that dollars could be exchanged for gold at $35
per ounce. The other countries signing the agreement, then pegged
their currencies to the US dollar within a one percent deviation.

The Bretton Woods agreements also created the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The IMF was formed
to be the central bank to the world’s central banks. It monitors
exchange rates. And, like any central bank in a reserve system, it sets
targets for interbank lending and _has the power to create new money_
for its members by lending (to its members and to nations with trade
deficits).

After the US dollar was decoupled from any commitment to
exchange it for gold in 1971, the use of the dollar as global reserves
began to decline. It dropped to a low of 46 percent in 1991. By
the mid 1990s it was back in the mid-60th percentiles, where it
has held.<sup>289</sup>

The US dollar shares the role of reserve currency. In late 2016,
65 percent of global reserves were in dollars. The remaining reserves
are in Euros, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss francs,
Canadian dollars, and since September 2016, the Chinese renminbi.
In 2016, total global foreign exchange reserves reported to the IMF
were $10.8 trillion, of which US dollars accounted for roughly $5
trillion.<sup>290</sup> So, we have a domestic money supply of $14–18 trillion
(depending on what you’re counting [(Chapter 5.49)](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-5/section-49) and another $5
trillion is abroad serving as reserves. Most of those reserve dollars
were created by global bankers.

As China and other countries show increasing economic strength, it
is reasonable and prudent to assume that the role of the dollar as a
reserve currency will gradually diminish, even in our current system.
To make that transition steady and comfortable, we need to maintain
the world’s confidence in our leadership and the strength of our
common wealth. We are not doing well.

We have elected a president most of us don’t like, whose favorability
rating with the rest of the world was in the low teens _before_ the
election. In 2016 when the PEW Research Center surveyed global
attitudes towards Donald Trump, our newly elected president, more
74 percent of the people in every one of the 15 leading countries had
NO confidence in Trump’s ability to do the right thing regarding
world affairs. Our allies – the UK, Germany, France, Japan had
confidence levels ranging from 6–12%. Poor favorability ratings of our president translate into unfavorable views of the US, which dropped
from 64 percent at the end of Obama’s term to 49 percent under
Trump.<sup>291</sup> And, that was before his inauguration.

In his first two months in office, President Trump insulted the
leaders of Great Britain, Australia, Japan, Germany, Mexico, and
Iran. He withdrew the US from the Global Climate Accord and
the Iran Nuclear Deal. He insulted the continents of Africa and
South America. In Summer 2018 he insulted Canada, further rudely
insulted all of our NATO allies, called the European Union, _America’s
foe,_ Germany_ a captive to Russia,_ and lavished praise on the world’s
dictators – particularly the Russian leader responsible for a cyber and
information attack on our elections, and on the elections and utility
grids of other NATO members.<sup>292</sup>

Then for a little more turmoil, he started a trade war with allies,
neighbors and China. He’s planning to run up the deficit further
using at least $12 billion to replace the lost sales for farmers.

By the third quarter of 2017 the US Dollar had lost 10 percent of its
value against its peers and it’s use as a reserve currency dropped to
63 percent of all reserves.<sup>293</sup> Keeping in mind the rate of increase in
the supply of dollars, that 2 percent drop is significant.

While Trump supporters have been gleefully thumbing their nose at
the rest of the world’s opinion, they have been cutting off their nose
to spite their face, as the saying goes. This very low level of confidence
is a warning sign of consequences to come. And, they are coming.

Our friendly neighbor Canada is considering using their equivalent
of the Magnitsky Act, to sanction our president’s personal businesses
and wealth as retaliation in the trade war he started.<sup>294</sup> Germany
is stepping into our leadership role in NATO.<sup>295</sup> China is stepping
into the role of world leader, investing $1,663 billion in global
infrastructure projects in the decade from 2009 to 2018. These
investments will provide them with customers well into the next
century.<sup>296</sup>

The world may decide the US no longer deserves this privileged position of major reserve currency. Remember it’s about confidence
in the future. Should the world decide to use more of a different
currency, or, as some nations are considering, change their money
systems so they no longer need to keep dollars tucked away, they will
spend these dollars into circulation. These reserves were $5 trillion
(2016) – roughly equivalent to one-third of the reported size of our
money supply. If and when the use of this money is dismissed by
other nations, it will come back to roost in our own economy. If
it happens in a short time, it may cause catastrophic inflation, a
monumental crash and depression. If the crash has already happened
in the routine cycle of boom to bust, then this US dollar dump will
make it devastatingly worse. We need a plan in place to weather this
storm. See [Chapters 8–10.](https://usmoney.us/book)

## The planet

We are quite literally on a path to our destruction. Earth as a living
system will continue, but like the dinosaurs, humans may not be part
of it. We only have one earth available. Charts of our exploitation
of potable water, arable land and depletion of natural resources
show the same exponential curve as our money supply. Our world
faces an acute and violent meltdown as the wealth transfer machine
reaches nearly unfathomable inequality. Oxfam, an international
confederation of 18 non-governmental organizations, says the top
one percent of the world will own more than that owned by the
other 99 percent together by 2020. This is in just two short years!
From 2009–2014 the wealth of the wealthiest doubled.<sup>297</sup> This is the
speed at which wealth is being transferred into the hands of a few
extraordinarily rich people. Think of the poverty, desperation and war
this will bring!

Already this rising income inequality is increasing strife and violence.
When we are frightened and worried about basic survival, it is human
nature to lean back to childhood solutions: a strong and powerful
Daddy will take care of us; fascist authoritarian rulers and violence
make sense to our child mind. The grey drops out of thinking and
people want black and white; clear and simple rhetoric that defines
who’s at fault and who wins the day. When people are starving or
working 60 hours a week and living out of their car, they’re not
interested in discussing public issues and long-term incremental
change. People are more willing to fall behind a pied piper who
promises to make everything great again with his personal strength
and _“very stable genius.”_ There is a readying to hunker down in armed
bunkers against everyone else. This is how militarists and dictators
emerge. This is already happening around the world. It will only
get worse. There are signs we are heading toward living in gated
communities and ghettos in a police state. We do not have to go
there; we can call on our better selves and change the money system.

And now you understand how the money system causes the
consumerism, exploitation and the transfer of wealth destroying us.
