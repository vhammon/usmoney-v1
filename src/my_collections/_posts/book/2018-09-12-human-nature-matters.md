I’ve read about 100 books on money, including many tomes by
the acknowledged experts of economics. Throughout my studies I
noticed the authors overlook or minimize a vital aspect of economics one that could transform the theory and practice to benefit everyone in society. The more I researched the more I wondered: **Why don’t** **these brilliant economic theorists discuss how money is created** **and introduced into the economy?**

How money is created and entered into the economy is a powerful
influence. But even the authors who did explain the process did
so in a few paragraphs and then slid right past the meaning and
implications of their own explanations. It seemed as if someone had
performed a Jedi mind trick on them – or they were playing a mind
trick on themselves and the rest of us. How can these experts be
unaware of such obvious blind spots?

In my research, I also examined every Federal Reserve consolidated
financial report back to 1914. I built a spreadsheet about the money
supply using key numbers from these reports – the different kinds
of assets and liabilities and the net equity. Charted, the numbers in
the spreadsheet form a clear exponential growth curve of the money
supply and today we are on the steep upward end of the money
supply curve.

History tells us in our current money system, when the money supply
grows outlandishly large, it must be corrected – and the natural
means of correction in our current money system is recession or
depression. The pendulum cannot swing wildly in one direction
without swinging the other way just as wildly. The graph tells us a
whopper of a correction – a depression – is on the way; dire outcomes
are evident and imminent and most of the nation will suffer grievous
harm. How can so many well paid experts ignore the story here?
I’ve searched for answers. The why resides in our human nature.

I have included this section on human nature in the foundation
material because it is important to understand why we continue with a money system that causes so much harm. It is also important to
understand how so many schools of economics can teach incorrect
information about our money system for generations, resulting in
poorly informed pundits, politicians and voters. Certainly, the few
who benefit have enough power to keep the myths in place. But why
do so many people accept the myths so readily?
I’ve done my best to select characteristics that most impact our choice
of money system. Here are a few of the mind quirks that make all of
us vulnerable to pyramids and exponential growth schemes, including
our current money system.

## Our body chemistry affects our actions and decisions

Our body chemistry is the foundation of our behaviors. Medical
researchers have only begun to understand that we are a complex and
extraordinary suite of chemical reactions. Current research finds that
changes in this chemistry can exaggerate existing behaviors, though
they do not necessarily cause them. We are also capable of consciously
overriding chemically generated impulses. However, generally, our
body chemistry has an impact on our behavior.

### Adrenaline rush

We are hardwired to respond to opportunity and danger in a similar
way: the blood flows into our arms and legs and out of the frontal
lobes of our brains. This is very handy if we need to hunt for food
or survive in a physically dangerous world. We are ready to pounce
or run as if our lives depend on it. Today, our body responds pretty
much the same way, whether we’re faced with danger or an exciting
opportunity. We can’t always tell the difference.

We are hardwired to sniff out and respond with adrenaline to low
investment-high reward situations. Finding true opportunities is
a good survival skill; however, what serves us can also make us
vulnerable. Our adrenaline begins to pump at the possibility of
easy wealth and then – swoosh – we’re an easy mark. Or if we get
in on the deal early enough, we can set aside any ethical and moral considerations and take advantage of the other marks who come
after us.

While adrenaline sends extra blood to our extremities which helps
us act fast and grab the opportunity quickly, the amount of blood-
borne oxygen going to the brain’s frontal lobes drops (where
complex, rational, abstract and moral thinking resides). It’s patsy
time. Too-good-to-be-true opportunities usually have a time-pressure
component: Act Now! Don’t LOSE OUT! The time-pressure keeps the
adrenaline flowing and oxygen out of the scam-detecting part of our
brain. Our whole body tingles with the expectation of a big reward.

Our news and media, owned by the few who benefit from the system,
support this constant adrenaline-pumping, fear or opportunity-based
hype, which continually exploits and reinforces this response.

## Environment and culture matter because we are social

### The culture and people around us

We respond to our surroundings and the people around us almost
automatically and unconsciously. For example, yawns are contagious.
People dining together will lift their water glasses in unison. We
eat more if the people around us are eating more. And we eat more
when our food is served on a larger plate. When we recognize what
is shaping our behavior, we can sometimes change it. For example,
switching from a dinner plate to a smaller luncheon plate can help us
eat less.1 2 3

### Follow the leader

Authority influences all of us to some degree. This begins when we
are children and the mind frame stays with us in some measure for
life. At the extreme, think of Hitler’s Germany and the experiments
of Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. He found that many people are
willing to obey an authority figure and torture, even kill a fellow
human when told to do so by an authority.^4 These experiments have
been repeated in many cultures, times, and places. A remarkably
consistent 60–65 percent of people will inflict fatal harm when instructed by an authority to do so. So it should be no surprise that it
is relatively easy to maintain a monetary system that does significant
harm, when so many in positions of authority say it is a good and
worthy system.

Our tendency to be influenced by authority can have life-threatening
impacts. For example, medical mistakes are the third leading cause
of death in the US after heart disease and cancer.^5 Some of these
mistakes go unchallenged even when observed, because staff are
unwilling to challenge the authority making the mistake. To reduce
these numbers, hospitals are putting in place systems to train staff
and patients to challenge authority and assure mistakes are caught
in time. It is time to recognize this follow-the-leader handicap in the
fields of politics and economics, and take comparable action.

### Self-limitation

The culture we grow up in can function as a guiding and limiting
authority. There is a story of a big fish tank. Researchers put a
plexiglass divider down the middle and then put a school of fish
into one side of the tank. About halfway through their life cycle, the
researchers removed the plexiglass divider. The fish remained on their
side of the tank, just as if the divider were still in place. The story may
be apocryphal but there is an underlying truth.

We tend to gather with like-minded people because it feels safe
and comfortable. Like the fish in the aquarium, we may not even
consider swimming to the other side of the tank. It is challenging
to understand the viewpoints of people with whom we have
fundamental differences and no real common experience. We have
to stretch our brains to recognize the greatest wisdom comes from
aggregating the views of many genuinely independent and different
people, and struggle to understand all views. That is how we learn
and mature.

For generations the President’s Economic Advisory Council,
Treasurer and the Head of the Federal Reserve System have been
from Wall Street or from the academic institutions funded by Wall
Street. However bright, experienced, and well-intentioned, they are creatures of Wall Street; they have spent their entire careers living and
breathing the assumptions of the people who live and work on Wall
Street. Their thinking is limited by their groupthink experience. And
that is dangerous, as our current situation demonstrates.

### We are easily swayed by others

While it is important to look to our body health and chemistry for
the foundation of our behavior, we are also clearly influenced by our
surroundings. Most obviously, we are swayed in our social behavior.
Think of fads. Think of popular style. Think of the Emperor and his
New Clothes.

People will agree with others, even when their eyes, ears, or minds
tell them the others are wrong. The Asch Conformity experiments
developed in the 1950s (and still used today) use seven confederates
and one subject all sitting in a row looking at a series of boards
with two vertical lines of varying lengths. Each person in the row
is asked which of two lines is longer. When the first seven people –
confederates of the experimenter who are instructed to give wrong
answers – give the clearly wrong answer, the subject struggles but
more often than not agrees with the people who had gone before,
even though their answer is obviously wrong. About 65 percent of the
subjects agreed with the others rather than stand alone in dissent.^6

However, when only one other person gave the correct answer,
many more subjects also stated the correct answer. This is why
it is important to speak up when you think someone is making
an incorrect assessment or choice. One person speaking up often
represents others who agree, but hesitate to say so.

When we recognize this tendency toward groupthink, we can
take steps to assure we have independence and diversity in all our
community decision-making bodies – at local, state and federal levels.
Only in diversity will we have our assumptions challenged and the
widest selection of constructive options available.

## We are NOT rational

Most of the economic philosophers of the 18th through 20th
centuries made the assumption that humans are always rational from
a self-centered perspective. Believing even bad decisions stem from
a rational reason, economics philosophers assumed in every market
exchange both parties were getting what they rationally wanted.
Because everyone was acting rationally, the combined economic
behavior would act like an unseen force that arrives at just prices.
Early economist Adam Smith, in The Wealth of Nations (1776), coined
the term the invisible hand to describe _“the unobservable market force
that helps the demand and supply of goods in a free market to reach
equilibrium automatically.”_ As long as people are free to act on their
rational choices, the marketplace will function to efficient perfection.
No need for standards, or regulations...Free the Market and all
will be well!

Well, at the belated urging of brain scientists, social anthropologists,
and common sense, even economists are now admitting the rational
market and its invisible hand are wrong. We are not rational; we
generally use reasoning to justify existing ideas and choices, not to
make them. We are easily led astray by advertisers, impulses and
mind quirks.

## We ignore the fact that we are not rational

### We have selective attention.

We are susceptible to many illusions. In their entertaining book,
_Gorillas in our Midst,_ experimenters Christopher Chablis and Daniel
Simons find when people are focused, and particularly when they are
experts focused on accomplishing a task, they often fail to see things
right in front of them. In one study, pilots practicing landings on
simulators fail to see a big plane sitting on the runway. In another
study, ordinary people fail to see a gorilla in a video because they have
been given a task that requires focused attention.^7 This may explain
how economists can focus on specific sets of numbers they have been taught to value and fail to see the underlying system and the impact
of the numbers on society as a whole.

### We justify and rationalize – especially when we are wrong.

We tend to use our rationality to back up what we already believe.
We begin with an idea and then look for proof and a rationale to
prove we are right. When confronted with facts that do not fit our
preconceived idea, we tend to ignore them, because they have no
place in any of the file folders of our minds. When we are confronted
with undeniable evidence we are wrong, our brains swing into
hyperdrive to protect our sense of self; we often dismiss clear evidence
if it requires admitting error.

Our blindness to facts that do not fit is called cognitive dissonance.
An excellent book, _Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We
Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts_ by Carol Tavris
and Elliot Aronson, is full of examples of how, once formed, our
ideas are difficult to shift.^8 Prosecutors who have found a man guilty
are often reluctant to change their opinion even when confronted
with irrefutable evidence they were wrong. Dietitians continue
recommending certain unhealthful foods despite decades of research
showing those foods are slowly killing us. The more we feel invested
in being right, the more likely we are to ignore or dismiss counter
information, even when confronted with the serious harm our error
is causing.

And that is why so many economists, pundits and politicians cling to
ideas about money even though the evidence says they are wrong. We
can choose to be better than this, to do our best to understand ideas
in conflict with our own.

## We are learners

Perhaps most important, we are capable of learning and changing.
We can learn to step outside our perspectives and see the influences
that our upbringing and surroundings have on our thinking. We can
shift from judgment to curiosity and choose to be learners. If we’re
humble about our own certainties, if we’re willing to read and study from many points of view, we will understand that each person may
have an important piece of the whole picture.

We make choices every day and every moment. Will we be mindless
sheep following our flock, trusting our leaders will protect us from
the wolves? Will we be so busy with our daily lives that we fail to see
the gorilla in our midst? Will we be farsighted and wise?
