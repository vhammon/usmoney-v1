https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-4https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-8There are three aspects to the _how_ of money creation: the tangible, the
intangible, and how money is entered into an economy. This is true
whether or not the actual money token itself is tangible.

## Hands on

Every type of token, tangible or not, requires some hands-on effort
to create it. Physical money tokens like coins and bills incur costs for
mining the metals, and turning them into coins, or creating fancy
printed paper. Even creating virtual monies requires paying someone
to make the keyboard entries – and then there are always overhead
costs. So, it always costs money to produce money.

Roughly 3 percent of the world’s money today is tangible – a physical
token of metal or paper.

Roughly 97 percent of the money in the world is a record, either
digital or written, and it is created with a few strokes on a computer
keyboard (or in a hand-written ledger). This ratio of cash to
accounting record money is true of all the major money systems
in the world today. Both cash and accounting record money have
production costs.

## Magic

Then, with all money, there is a nearly magical transformation from
a manufactured token to a token with money value. This is true
whatever the token, whether paper, gold or any other material. This
magic happens when people in a community agree to use a token as
money at a specific face value.

The cost of producing money – even virtual currency or commodity
money – is generally less than the face value of the money unit. This
is easiest to see with a paper bill. For example, a US $100 bill costs
$0.13 to make. When this piece of fancy paper moves into circulation
its value jumps to $100. Where does the $99.87 come from? And,
who gets to pocket the difference between the manufacturing cost (13
cents) and the street value ($100)?

This difference is called seignorage, meaning the right of the lord.
Historically the right to create new money belonged to the seignor,
whoever ruled – the temple, church, king or lord of the manor. But
the privilege of money creation can belong to a government, to
institutions in the public or private sector or to individuals. This is
a choice.

While it is easiest to see the difference between the manufacturing
cost of money and its face value with paper money, this difference is
also present with commodity money and with virtual money. When
gold has been used as money, the wholesale mining costs, plus the
coinage production costs have generally been less than the value of
the gold as a coin.

The magic that transforms any material into money makes me think
of a game used to build rapport called a _trust fall._ In one version,
someone stands in the middle of a tight circle with their arms folded.
They fall in one direction and then are pushed back upright and over
toward someone else. As long as everyone participates, the person in
the center will not fall. As long as everyone accepts money as money,
it works great.

## HOW do people enter money into an economy?

There are four general ways new money can enter an economy:
giving, spending, investing, or lending. In all methods of money
creation, some form of government plays a role. It may give the
actual power of creation to private entities, while providing authority
and trustworthiness, as do most current systems, or it may exercise
the money creation power directly. Again, it is a choice. Let’s use an
example and look at the various choices available for moving money
into an economy.

Let’s say we have a large and robust economy that currently uses
11,293 billion units of money. We decide by the end of the coming
year, we want to have 11,917 billion units of money in circulation.
(How we decide on the amount of new money needed is another
issue, addressed in Chapter 8.)

We decide to increase the money supply by 625 billion units – an
increase of 6 percent. If we could have any money system we want,
what would be our choices for putting an additional 625 billion
money units into the economy?^9

### Gifting into the economy

New money can be gifted into an economy. If we want 625 billion
additional units, here is how it we could do it.

#### TO INDIVIDUALS

Whoever has the power to create new money could write a check to
every adult in our population (or drop the money into their bank
account with an accounting entry). For example, our money creator
could write a check for 2,788 units to 240 million adults (less the cost
of printing and issuing the checks or making the data entries). That
would add 625 billion units to the money supply and provide the
most equitable distribution and diverse use of the new money. Most
people would likely spend the money and it would circulate, picking
winners and losers in the marketplace by consumer choice. People
might pay down debt, freeing them to shift from debt service to other
spending. They might put the money into long term savings, giving
the banks money to invest on their behalf.

Economists refer to this method of introducing money into an
economy as a _helicopter drop,_ a term first used by 20th century
economist, Milton Friedman.^10 The difference between the piece
of paper or accounting entry representing units of money and the
value in the marketplace – so called, _seignorage_ – would go to every
adult citizen.

#### TO STATES

Whoever has the power to create new money could give it to states,
by some system deemed fair to all concerned. The states could turn
around and give this new money to their citizens, or they could
choose another method of introducing the money into the economy,
such as spending, lending, or investing. The seignorage would go to
the states and their citizens.

If fairness and equity are values in the giving, then government is best
able to gift new money into an economy, since it has the information
and the means to make the gifts equitably to the entire population.
Of course, one could give the power to create new money to a few
individuals and allow them to give the new money to whomever they
choose. However, that embodies a different set of values.

### Spending into the economy

New money can be spent into the economy. If we want to add 625
billion units to the money supply, here is how it could be entered
into the economy by spending it.

Whoever has the power to create new money, could spend this money
into the economy by paying for improvements to our common
wealth: cleaning up our air and water; repairing our watersheds,
bridges and roads; prenatal care and family time with newborn
citizens; reducing the student-to-teacher ratio in our schools or
anything deemed a priority. What a lot of jobs that would create! Or
whoever has the power to create new money, could spend it into the
economy by buying personal yachts, vacation homes, or buy stocks,
bonds and real estate.

To use the US as an example, in 2014, our federal government spent
a total of $552 billion on non-defense discretionary spending, which
included, in billions:

* $24 for agriculture
* $67 for education
* $27 for energy
* $80 for health and human services
* $27 for the administration of justice
* $18 for transportation
* $243 for all else (includes funding for natural resources and
    environment; general science, space, and technology; general
    government; community and regional development; Social
    Security administration, and commerce and housing).^11

If we decide to add $625 billion to our economy each year, we
could almost triple the expenditures in the six major categories
above. Or, for example, we could focus on one of those categories:
transportation infrastructure, an area neglected over the past 50 years.
The American Society of Civil Engineers has given the US a D+ for
infrastructure, citing many structurally deficient bridges and potholed
highways, which compromise business efficiency and individual safety.
They estimate we need to spend an additional $163 billion annually
over a six-year period to bring our surface transportation system up
to a well-functioning standard.^12

If our government had the power to create new money and decided
to add $625 billion to the economy every year for the next 6 years by
spending on fixing our transportation infrastructure, we could not
only bring our transportation network up to _well-functioning,_ we
could take our infrastructure into a sustainable, renewable energy
producing and money-saving future – high-speed cross country rail;
paint city streets white in hot climes to cool and save energy; put
solar panels or energy generators in highways...^13

In this case, the seignorage would accrue to the public through the
enhanced value of the transportation system. There would be no need
 to increase taxes to pay for these infrastructure improvements and
no interest on debt accruing – another big bonus. And, think of the
well-paying jobs this would create, again benefiting our communities
as the bridge and public transit builders spent their wages!

Again, using the US and the dollar as an example, if we wanted to
add $625 billion in money to the economy, what else could America
choose to spend it on? Are there spending priorities that could
benefit the nation as a whole? How about funding elections so special
interest groups cannot buy candidates? Prenatal and childhood health
care? Preschool education for all children? Higher education through
graduate school? Healthcare for all? Sustainable energy initiatives?
High speed national broadband? Well-funded, diverse, local public
broadcasting? Space exploration?

On the other hand, we could give a select group of people the power
to spend new money into the economy, with or without constraints
on how they choose to spend it. We could give them the power to
spend it freely, unencumbered by regulations or standards. That
certainly embodies a different set of values.

### Investing into the economy

New money can be invested into an economy. If we want 625 billion
additional units, here is how it we could do it.

Whoever has the power to create new money could decide on
technologies that they believe are important to the future – medical
research and development, sustainable energy, deep sea and space
exploration – then fund the long-term research and development
required, and hold ownership of the proceeds in the common wealth.

In this case, the seignorage would accrue to the public through the
innovations that enrich life for everyone.

Again, using the US and the dollar as an example, if we wanted to
add $625 billion to the money supply, we could increase research and
development dollars in our universities, freeing them to do research
 and development unfettered by the demands of proprietary private
interests.

On the other hand, we could give a select group of people the
power to created money for investment and let them choose what
to develop.

### Lending into the economy

Whoever has the privilege of creating the new money can lend it
into the economy. This is how IOU money systems work, which are
explained in [Chapter 4.29–4.36.](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-4) The money creator gets an IOU – a
lien on future production from the borrower, and then creates new
money against this IOU. Interest may or may not be charged on
this loan.

If we want to add 625 billion units to the money supply, whoever
has the power to create new money can pick and choose who gets
to borrow 625 billion new money units. For example, if a federal
government has the power to create new money, it could use a
national decision-making process to determine a priority list of
desired development: Say 20 percent each for Main Street small
business, sustainable and clean energy, broadband infrastructure,
innovative and globally competitive national manufacturing capacity,
and sustainable resource management. The loans could be made to
qualifying companies. Of course someone must do the tedious work
of figuring out the specifics of who qualifies, and what projects get
the loans. And we would want to avoid cronyism and corruption.

A cooperative membership community can create new money to
be used within their co-op by making loans to members that are
guaranteed by the member’s assets. This is still creating money by
lending money it into a community. The Swiss WIR, a money that
complements the Swiss national money, is an example of this kind
of system. (It was initially named the Swiss Economic Circle – in
German, Wirtschaftsring-Genossenschaft, or in short, WIR.)^14

The WIR is used within a membership of businesses who agree to use
it to buy and sell from each other. Systems with cooperative forms of
 governance, that lend money into creation, are sometimes named by
the type of governance that chooses the system. For example, Bernard
Lietaer, an expert on money, now at the Center for Sustainable
Resource Development at the University of California, Berkeley,
refers to mutual credit money systems and cooperative currencies.
These descriptors focus on the type of government choosing to use
the money system, not so much on how money is created or how it
functions, which can be confusing.

Any kind of government with the power to create new money by
lending could lend the money at nominal interest (enough to manage
the loan program) to members, states and municipalities, or private
banks, and the decisions on how the money is lent could be made
at this community level within a priority framework, or not. As
money was repaid, this money would be extinguished, requiring the
government to relend the money to keep the supply stable.

Or, a government could say, _“Let’s allow the private banks to create
$625 billion in new money by lending it into the economy, and we’ll let
bankers decide who should get it and how this new money should be
invested.”_

**This is our current system.** Our private banking sector created $625
billion in 2017, according to the records of the Federal Reserve. What
did they do with it? They did with it as they pleased.

### A Combination

And, of course, whoever has the power to decide how money will
be created can set up a combination of giving, spending, lending,
or investing. For example, if the federal government had the power
to create new money, it could give it to state governments, which
would then give part of it to citizens outright, spend some of it
on state infrastructure, and loan some of it to private businesses.
The government could also establish a primary system and
complementary systems. We’ll consider this in [Chapter 8.](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-8)
