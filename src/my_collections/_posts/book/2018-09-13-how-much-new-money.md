## Enough to keep the value stable

This is critically important and a guiding principle.

## How will we decide how much?

We do not want to privilege special interests – whether the interests want
to make more money for themselves or remain in office or a government
job. And, however much we believe that a small group of professionals can make an unbiased and professional decision for us all, any small
group will have bias and their own interests. The more they are _experts,_
the more likely they will fall into groupthink.

Good decision-making theory says we do NOT want to consolidate
information gathering and analyses into one agency. It is better to have
redundancy and more than one method of calculating the stability of
our money. Having multiple perspectives strengthens our ability to
make the best decision.

So having a small group of elites become a monetary authority that
decides for us is not a good idea; it would result in an inferior decision.
However, we can have a Monetary Authority that aggregates the perceptions, suggestions and choices of many, and reports a consensus decision.

WE must design a process that gives us the best estimate from a broad
range of professionals _and_ incorporates full civic participation. Here are
some suggestions about how we could do that.

### Aggregate from the many

We want our decision grounded in research, data collection and the analysis of professionals who have experience, knowledge and insight. They
have the ability to collect, critically review and understand a great deal
of economic data. We want their best guess as to how much new money
we need, or how much needs to be removed to _keep the value stable._

Inevitably, the questions they ask determine the data set, which then
has a perspective and some bias. So, how can we do our best to remove
the impact of bias? We aggregate diverse, independent and informed
estimates from multiple perspectives.

Many government agencies collect and analyze data: The Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA) within the Department of Commerce; the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) within the Department of Labor, which
maintains the Consumer Price Index; the Fed; the Census Bureau; and,
State government offices. This is a rich trove of economic data, collected
from differing points of view.

We will get the best guesstimate of how much new money to create by
having these many agencies submit their recommendations, including
their supporting facts and analysis, and then find the average. Please
read James Suroweicki’s _Wisdom of Crowds_ (2005). It’s a foundational
read about why democratic decision-making gets the best results.

For example, the Governor’s Office of every State, the Boards of the
regional branches of our Bank of the US, the BEA, and the BLS can
all submit recommendations. Their findings must be publicly distributed and open to review.

We can also invite private groups to submit estimates, similar to the way
our Supreme Court allows independent parties to submit briefs on a
case. These would fall under the same requirement for publication and
public review, and could give us the perspective of private bankers, businesses, labor unions, and wage-earners.

For the broadest and best possible estimate, we can include a single-line question on every individual and business tax return: How stable
have overall prices been this year for you on a scale of 1–10? The answers
can be totaled and averaged, and, included in the average for the final
decision. How these various estimates are weighted can be a formula
decided by Congress. For example: Individual tax return estimates –
30 percent; Business tax returns – 30 percent; Our professional data collectors – 40 percent. How would you like to see the suggestions
weighted, and why?

## Monetary Commission or Authority

We need a central body to gather and review the recommendations from
all of the above. Using a formula determined by Congress, this commission will aggregate, weight and average the recommendations, present
the outcome, and prepare a summary justification for Congress. This
report would include the recommendations from each perspective as
well as the aggregate.

Under ordinary circumstances this recommendation is final. Congress
can establish and alter _the formula,_ but Congress will not have the
authority to alter the decision about how much money to create, with-
out a sound justification and a super majority.

The law can require a set aside for emergencies, such as a massive natural disaster. If that set-aside is inadequate for the size of the emergency,
a super majority of Congress could make an exception and create additional money. But, in ordinary circumstances the Commission would
set the amount of new money to be created.

We will have to consider how this commission should be appointed, what
the job requires of members, how long their terms, and where in the
structure of government this commission should reside. It does not need
to be _independent_ of government oversight. In a democratic republic, we
should be wary of creating seats of power outside the oversight of our
Constitutional balance of power. The Government Accountability Office
can be funded to review the Monetary Authority periodically to assure
they are doing their task well and without corruption. If the requirement for transparency and publication of all data and analysis is upheld,
corruption will be much less likely. But, oversight is always useful.

### Three-year cycles

Some money reformers are suggesting a weekly assessment and
recommendation by a Money Authority, and weekly new money creation
to match. _This is not a good idea._ It would be attempting to micromanage our enormous economy, without giving the market a chance to
settle into any adjustments. It would be a recipe for needless volatility,
crazy making and crisis management. We’d be changing course mid-step.
Tasking a small group of people with making this sort of judgment so
frequently only produces poor results. It takes time to gauge how a trial
is working and it takes a broader and more diverse group to get best
decisions. Maybe in 30 years we will have enough data to create algorithms that track, assess and manage the money supply. But, we do not
have this data now, and it will take time and some experimenting.

A three-year interval for making a policy change is a good choice. In
my experience there is a three-year cycle to most new learning: the first
year one scrambles to figure out the new and how best to learn mastery.
The second year one practices and learning is comfortable. The third
year mastery develops. In economic terms, this means the first year will
be a bit chaotic as individuals, institutions and businesses scramble to
figure out what the change means to them. In the second year, things
settle down as business climbs a learning curve. And, in the third year
we make a reasonably sound assessment of how we are doing and how
we need to adjust the rate of new money creation. We could extend
unemployment benefits for these first years while the economy adapts.

We could certainly set aside a percentage of the three-year plan’s new
money creation, to be available not only for emergencies, but for tweaking and experimenting with the general plan – keeping in mind too
many tweaks and it will be impossible to assess how and what is responsible for the results.

Our data gathering institutions can continue to publish weekly, monthly
and annual reports on how we are doing, just as they do today. We can
ask them to make annual reports on how they think the current money
creation strategy is working. And, every third year, their report will make
a definitive recommendation for the following three years.

### Is the money value stable?

The overriding assessment criteria for how well we’re doing with our
guesstimate of how much new money to create will be: is the value of
our money truly stable?

On the first day of this new system the amount of money in the system
will not change. But, the banks have been increasing the total supply
by about 8 percent on average every year for the past 100 years. Some
people credit this expanding money supply with being the driver for
innovation, new development and a thriving economy. Remember a
thriving economy has been defined as a growing-in-size economy. This
intermittent boom-bust growth has been responsible for improvements
and declines in the quality of our lives, the shrinking of our middle
class, and _the destruction of our planet._ So, can we have the improvements without the destruction?

**What is the just right amount of money in an economy to keep the
value stable, keep innovation happening, maximize the number of
people living healthy and prosperous lives, and provide good stewardship to all life on our small blue planet?**

### We will have to experiment and find out.

It will take a little trial and error to achieve truly stable value money.
In addition to discovering how much new money creation maintains
a stable value, we want good information on the impact of how _new
money is entered_ into the economy. This means we need a way to isolate
how new money is entered into the economy from how much new
money is created.

### Weaning off the growth imperative

The best way to isolate how new money is entered is to maintain the
same average increase of new money creation for a couple years with
only the change in who has the power to create it. If the increase remains
the same, then changes can be more accurately attributed to the new ways money is entered into the economy. That will help us learn what
works best.

We are accustomed to growing the supply substantially every year –
by nearly 8 percent. It would be helpful to deliberately plan to slowly
wean ourselves from this rate of increase. For example, the first three
years of implementation our government would create the same average increase the private banks have been creating for the past 100 years.
This would make it easier to see the differences in the economy due to
the change in _system_ because changes could not be credited to a change
in the _amount_ of new money. The predictability of the increase would
also support an easier transition.

The increase in 2017 under our old system is expected to be **$941 billion.**
This could be added to the pot of new money that the government gives,
spends, lends, or invests into circulation.

We could then decrease the rate of increase by one percent every three
years...7% – 6% – 5% – 4%. For the past 100 years, while the average
rate remained relatively steady at about 8 percent the rate swung wildly
from negative one percent to 11 percent. When everyone expects and
plans for a gentle slowing down of the increases, it should introduce
a new level of stability to the economy. Within 20 to 30 years, we will
have mastered how much money is required to maintain a stable value
and prosper. This may seem like an overly long time, but, it will be in
time for your children and grandchildren to survive and prosper on the
planet. And, a slower pace of change will support wiser choices and the
ability to navigate past inevitable mistakes.
