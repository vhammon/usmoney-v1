You will have more money to spend because everything will cost less
and you will pay less in taxes. You will have more power in public
decision-making – more control over the spending choices of your
community at local, state and federal levels. You will face less stress
and have more leisure and family time.

### Banking

Banking will only see one change for individuals. You will make depos-
its, use your debit card or write checks just as you do today. You will
be able to make deposits or take cash out of your bank. However, **you
will pay a specific fee for these banking services instead of paying
fees buried and hidden in the system itself.**

While it’s not an issue for most of us, the need for deposit insurance
will disappear. In our current system, deposit insurance covers only
$250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership cate-
gory. In a commonwealth money system, all deposits are held in a trust
account at our national central bank and are as safe as the survival of
our nation. No one’s deposits are vulnerable to loss from bankers’ deci-
sions. However, banks, as they do now, will keep a certain level of cash
on hand, depending on the needs of their customers. This cash would
be insured by the bank, just as a business insures inventory on hand.
Smaller local banks and branches usually have a higher need for cash
on hand as a percentage of their deposits (think of the cash needs of a
supermarket ATM branch and a bank on Wall Street). To support local
banking, WE may want to subsidize the insurance of this cash inven-
tory at smaller banks. That’s a policy choice.

### Borrowing

Banks will still serve as intermediaries between investors and borrowers.
There will be enough money to meet the credit needs of businesses and
individuals. Remember that our reliance and devotion to borrowing is a
product of our current system. In a system that does not require borrow-
ing to create enough money for commerce, there will not be the pressure
to continuously increase the amount of debt. As the pressure is elimi-
nated, the demand for credit will diminish. People will still borrow for
significant purchases, but we will be much less likely to impulse borrow.

We have come to believe that we just can’t function without our bank
credit cards. But, remember, these are a relatively recent innovation.
Within a lifetime ago, we did fine paying for our purchases or using a
store credit system (e.g. a Nordstrom or Macy’s card, which was not a
monetization of debt). You still do this when you buy a bed from a local
store and pay them for it over time. Small businesses also maintained
and often still maintain credit accounts with their suppliers, which
again, do not monetize debt. This system of business-to-business or
business-to-individual credit democratizes the issuance of credit. More
people make decisions about who gets credit, and more decision-mak-
ers strengthens a system. None of this credit is monetized.

Banks can still issue credit cards, but the system behind the cards will
have to change. The banks will no longer be able to create new money
when you use your card. They must have an investment fund from
which your credit transaction draws. Our financial industry is quite
capable of creating a system that issues credit cards without creating
new money. They demonstrate a masterful aptitude for creating arcane
financial instruments, so fashioning a common wealth money credit
card system is well within their capabilities.

The government will no longer be going into debt, which will free up
that money for other investing in the economy – including making loans
to individuals and small business. As of Q3 2017, total government debt
was 104 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP) of almost $19 tril-
lion. So, imagine the uses that money can be put to when government
no longer needs to borrow. There will be plenty of money available for
borrowing by individuals and business.
