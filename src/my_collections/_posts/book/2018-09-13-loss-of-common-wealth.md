Our situation is grim and depressing and needs to be addressed
NOW. Our common wealth is deteriorating and it guarantees
our money.

We are losing our natural, cultural, social and economic resources.
For most of the last century the US was a prosperous nation and the
dollar was a highly respected and relatively stable currency, prized
as a reserve and guarantor globally. You can follow this period of
prosperity and global respect on the exponential curve of our money
supply chart – it is the relatively flat part of the first two thirds of
the curve.

Today we are shooting nearly straight up the end of the curve and
we have deteriorating infrastructure, declining natural resources,
one third of our population popping heavy duty pain killers and
anti-depressants, an inability to respond to natural disasters like
Hurricanes Katrina and Maria, a corrupt financial system, and a
declining respect for our nation in the global community.

Common wealth must be stewarded; it needs care and protection.
But our current money system promotes the withering away of our
infrastructure. On the one hand, we do not adequately value our
natural and human resources, which allows big business to reap more
profits. And, then, because the bankers’ bad promises have been
increasing, we have been selling off our common wealth to private
interests to keep our promise to back up the bankers and the value of
our money. This strategy will ultimately destroy the nation.

## The exploitation and degradation of natural resources

The air we breathe and the water we drink are the fundamentals of
life – our most precious common wealth. Underground aquifers are
being depleted at rates well beyond the earth’s capacity to refill them.
The Ogallala aquifer, which stretches through eight states from South
Dakota to Texas and supplies 30 percent of the nation’s irrigated
groundwater, will be used up within 50 years _unless current water use is reduced._<sup>130</sup> If we don’t make radical changes, within a lifetime we
will not have the minimum of water required for basic human needs.
A wealthy elite are already training people to accept that water can
and should be privatized. Big corporate interests are sucking up water,
putting it into bottles and selling this natural resource. Soon, water,
and thus living, will be only for those who can afford it.<sup>131</sup>

In 1980, 21 percent of US land was arable (good for food growing).
In 2015, it was down to 17 percent.<sup>132</sup> We have nearly 470 million
acres of arable land in cultivation today – about 1.6 acres per person.
We are losing ONE MILLION acres _each year_ due to urbanization,
multiplying transportation networks and industrial expansion. By
2050, only 30 years from now, we will be down to about 1/2 acre per
person – not enough to sustain a diverse diet.

Yes, I’ve seen the futuristic stacking, no-earth gardens in imagined
cities. Will it be enough and nutritious? It’s a gamble with our
children’s lives, because changing the flora, fauna, land and
water changes the planet. There is good news. Organizations like
American Farmland Trust have been working successfully with state
governments to protect farmland. While they report we are still
losing 175 acres of farmland _every hour,_ for the past few years, the loss
has been slowing a tiny bit.<sup>133</sup>

We are losing millions of trees to drought, bark beetle, and fire – all
caused by hotter temperatures. More than 100 million trees have
died in California in the past few years, 62 million in 2016 alone.<sup>134</sup>
And, that’s not counting the trees we harvest or chop down to
accommodate development and other agricultural practices. Trees
protect our watersheds and clean our air. When the trees go, so go
our freshwater and fresh air systems.

Melting ice has reached a point of no return as the rate of loss
escalates faster than scientists expected.<sup>135</sup> These changes will have a
deadly impact on species acclimated to a specific region and climate.
The impact will be exponential. Deaths of little species and habitats at
one end of the food chain will pyramid into catastrophic loss.

We are squeezing the life out of the planet. In May, 2007 Ahmed Djoghlaf, head of the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity, said
that _“Extinction rates are rising by a factor of up to 1,000 above natural
rates. Every hour, three species disappear. Every day, up to 150 species are
lost.” _136 According to a 1998 survey of 400 biologists conducted by
New York’s American Museum of Natural History, nearly 70 percent
believed that we are currently in the early stages of a human-caused
mass extinction event, comparable to the End Cretaceous Extinction
that took place 66 million years ago. It already has names – the
Holocene, the Sixth, or the Anthropocene Extinction.<sup>137</sup>

The earth is an astounding complex web of abundant life. Every
single species, including humans, relies on a web of life we are only
beginning to understand. It is suicidal to destroy what is essential to
our lives. But, a system that demands exponential growth must find
and exploit new resources and new markets; it cannot ask, _“How can
we find a healthy equilibrium?”_

**This is now.** Unless we take immediate, strong action, we’re too late.
Life as we know it will be gone and humans may be extinct. We may
still have a rapidly closing window of time to change our behavior
and take remedial action. Prudence and stewardship demand it. If
we do not make radical change, all the rest of these consequences are
inconsequential.

In 2016, the Union of Concerned Scientists presented evidence that
ExxonMobil was aware of the threat posed by man-made climate
change as early as 1981. They spent millions to intentionally deceive
the public to preserve their fossil fuel profits.<sup>138</sup> They used their power
of great wealth to compromise life as we know it.

## The exploitation and degradation of social and cultural resources

We are blessed. We live in a nation with a Constitution that gives
us freedom to make responsible choices in a diverse and vibrant
economy. We are a democratic republic; we can participate in making
the laws that govern our lives. These are the _blessings of Liberty_ and a
significant building block of our common wealth.

An effective democracy requires three important components: citizens who are informed; independent thinkers; and who have diverse
worldviews, aptitudes, and knowledge bases. Over the past century, as
the money system transferred wealth to the very few, we significantly
diminished these attributes [(Chapter 6.72).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-6/section-72)

Jane Mayer, in her book, _Dark Money: The Hidden History of the
Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right_ (2016) tells us some
of the ways this happened. She tells stories of the corruption of our
public education, institutions of higher education, our judiciary
and our institutions of law-making and oversight by weaponized
philanthropy.<sup>139</sup> Here are a few.

After the Great Depression, most people were thoroughly disgusted
with corporate America’s greed and irresponsibility. Americans
wanted curbs on those who valued money over the general welfare.
We wanted standards and supervision over our food processors – no
more fingers or people falling into the meat grinders in Chicago.
Upton Sinclair’s book, _The Jungle_ (1906) about the meat-packing
industry, blew the whistle on that.

We wanted to put everyone to work who wanted to work and
created the Works Progress Administration. It gave over 8.5 million
Americans jobs and built heritage assets in national parks, schools and
hospitals. It reinvigorated civic centers and the economy. But no Big
Money interests skimmed off a profit, so these jobs and many aspects
of the New Deal were not welcome by the very wealthy few. They
needed a way to shift social and economic thinking away from taking
care of us all to increasing their private wealth. And, they succeeded.

In the early 20th century a small group of very wealthy people came
up with the idea of the Family Foundation tax dodge – put a billion
in a foundation, spend the _income_ for 20 years on philanthropy, and
then take ownership of the principle tax free. These foundations
did some public good. Some of the income they were required to
spend built libraries, university buildings, and art museums. But
by mid-century, they began using this income to turn our schools,
universities, judiciary, media, and churches into propaganda arms for
policies that increase their wealth.

### Our educational and research institutions

Since the 1980s, reduced taxes on the ultra-rich meant less tax
revenue. As public funding for education shrunk, schools became
dependent on the largesse of family foundations. For decades, family
foundations have paid for programs in our universities that promote
their economic and social agenda. They pay for the promotion of
ideas like cutting taxes on the rich, eliminating estate taxes, taxing
capital gains at a lower rate than wage income. Research and papers
produced by the programs they fund find justification for policies
that benefit the very wealthy at everyone else’s expense.

Academic research and writing are now deeply corrupted by the
agenda of the money power. Most law schools have family foundation
funded programs that promote free-from-regulation business law.
Many major universities have economics departments funded to
promote an ideology that supports the wealthy – deregulate, it’s OK
to kill employees or customers if it makes you money, lower taxes on
the rich, and privatize public services.

Big Pharma dictates medical research, assuring drug sales are the
treatment of choice taught in our medical schools; if it makes you
healthy, but doesn’t make anyone money, then it’s not worth studying
and funding will be hard to secure.

The recommendations for the food we eat are tainted, corrupted by
the interests of Big Ag and Big Food. For example, Tufts University
has one of the largest nutrition programs in the nation. With industry
partners (donors) their nutrition center promoted a _Smart Choices_
food labeling program to inform family food buyers with a check
mark on product packaging. The board making the decisions about
what is a smart choice is mostly food industry insiders. They gave
good food choice _checks_ to foods heavily laden with sugars and salts,
including _Froot Loops_ for kids’ breakfasts.<sup>140</sup> Labeling Froot Loops a
good breakfast choice renders the University’s activities suspect. One
wonders if all its research findings are equally corrupt and directed by
the interests of their donors.

Can our institutions of research and learning look for the truth, or
are they limited to looking for results the people who control their
funding want them to produce?

### Our judiciary

Jane Mayer also exposes how the ultra-rich have used their family
foundation money to change the curriculum in our law schools to
reflect ideas and policies that protect and enlarge their wealth. In
addition to funding departments and chairs in our law schools that
promote their view, they focus on changing the thinking of the
sitting judiciary. Today over 40 percent of sitting judges have been on
two-week intensive training and relaxation junkets at luxury resorts,
where the principles of leave-them-be-to-make-profits-any-way-they-
can capitalism are mainlined into jurisprudence. Mayer describes
these junkets as a combination of Soviet re-education camp and
Club Med – a free two weeks of morning seminars at luxury resorts
that promote a legal perspective favorable to the money power, and
afternoons by the pool. It’s hard to disagree with benefactors.

### Our churches

Kevin M. Kruse in his book, _One Nation Under God: How Corporate
America Invented Christian America_ (2016) tells the history of how
corporate America invested in conflating laissez-faire capitalism
with Christianity, co-opting and corrupting the message of Christ.
Wealthy owners of big corporations deliberately and successfully
worked to convince churches that the social gospel was communism;
a good Christian should equate gospel with free enterprise, laissez-
faire economics, deregulation, and the Republican Party. With many
churches, they succeeded.<sup>141</sup>

Beginning back in the 1930s, wealthy family foundations and
associations of big corporate owners gave cash rewards to ministers
who wrote sermons promoting free enterprise and an unregulated
marketplace. They compiled prize winning sermons and broadcast
them to churches. They subsidized ministers who were effective in
preaching what some call Libertarian Christianity. Over decades from the 1930s to the present, a substantial number of American
Christian churches shifted from the Social Gospel – help others, to
the Prosperity Gospel – help yourself first, a conflation of Libertarian
laissez-faire economics, Ayn Rand selfishness, and Christianity.
Instead of preaching to improve the nation’s spiritual life, some
ministers began to preach free enterprise, capitalism, deregulation,
the desirable and God-blessed accumulation of wealth, and the
rich as blessed by God to lead. They began to disparage the poor and
downtrodden.

It’s a sad day when those who would lead us to higher spirituality,
promote free-from-regulation capitalism and an idolatry of money
that is destroying our lives and our planet. It is a profound corruption
at our core: the anti-Christ with a 17,000 square foot home wearing
an Armani suit in the pulpit and preaching a love of Big Money.

Sadly, the end game of all this loss of our common wealth will benefit
neither the bankers nor the country.

### Attention!

I lived on the Big Island of Hawaii for almost twenty years and was
fascinated by the extraordinary power of its volcano. I was lucky to
see a red lava river up close and it is truly awe inspiring. In the early
days of 2018’s devastating eruption, I watched a news clip of a woman
who had just lost her home. Her home was built on a 1966 lava flow - a destructive event within her lifetime. Lava was fountaining nearby,
    she had been forced to evacuate by civil defense. Yet, she said, _“I
never expected to lose my home; I didn’t take out my belongings because
I thought I would be going back.”_ It is utterly human to be blind
to extraordinary events. We all do it. But, with awareness of this
tendency, we can stretch to pay attention. We must do this now.

**A declining common wealth is compromising the authority and
trustworthiness of our money.**
