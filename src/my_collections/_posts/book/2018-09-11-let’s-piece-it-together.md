I approach political issues with fervor. I love to gather information
from all sides, and enjoy finding the underlying issues and
agreements. I love the process of piecing together a coherent
understanding of issues. I do my best to understand the positions
that generate heat and passion, recognizing that what appears to be
a wacky idea may contribute to the best resolution of an issue. I also
do my best to admit my biases, and welcome someone pointing them
out as they can be hard to see from my perspective.

I’m deeply concerned about our country. We are fearful, huddling
in camps with people of like minds, and turning our neighbors into
fearsome enemies out to destroy our nation with their other beliefs.
We are besieged with escalating problems that we feel powerless to fix.
I believe we can piece together a better future.

The money system is a foundation of society. It carves channels
that constrain the ebb and flow of resources and productivity. Our
current money system is the root of many of our problems; it pushes
our society in specific directions. For this reason, it is important to
understand how and why our money system works the way it does.
Nearly everyone can agree our current money system has left us with
a mess. Let’s make a new choice and choose wisely.

Here are my goals:

1. To increase the number of people who understand our current
    money system and its inevitable outcomes, and then look at
    other options that more closely match our values.
2. To generate a national dialogue about making our money
    system match the value we place on a stable, healthy,
    prosperous nation.

To make understanding our money system easier, I begin with some
foundation concepts in the next section.
