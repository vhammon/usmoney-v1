Here’s a little sunshine on the Federal Reserve balance sheets.

##UNITED STATES FEDERAL RESERVE
STATEMENT OF CONDITION OF ALL FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS
COMBINED^63

### Notes for United States Federal Reserve
Statement of Condition of All Federal Reserve Banks Combined
(p.257–258):

1. Special drawing rights certificates are a kind of international
    exchange money
2. IOUs from others are listed in the accounts as “Securities purchased under
    agreements to resell,” and in 2011 includes, “Term Asset-Backed Securities
Loan Facility,” “Government-sponsored enterprise debt securities,” and
“Investments held by consolidated variable interest entities.”
3. Net notes: Notes outstanding (issued to banks) less notes held by the
    Federal Reserve Bank
4. IOUs TO others are listed in the accounts as “Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase
5. Deferred credit: generally something paid before its earned, hence a
    liability
6. If the space is blank, then this category was not itemized in that year and
    is likely in ‘other.’

## Worrisome rate of increase

You can readily see that there are some worrisome trends. For the
years from 2006 to 2016, the Fed’s balance sheet grew at an average
annual rate of 18 percent. For the years from 1996 to 2006 it grew at
a rate of six percent. For the past twenty years, the average annual
increase has been 12 percent. If one looks back over the lifetime of our
Federal Reserve System, from 1913 to the present, the assets grew by
8 percent per year. So, not only is the average rate of increase high at
8 percent, but the rate of increase is increasing. These rates of increase
are dramatic and unsustainable.

### Assets

Remember bank assets are mostly IOUs from others. Banks in our
current system juggle IOUs from others with their own IOUs, which
constitute our money supply. US government IOUs are the safe and
stable anchor of banks’ balance sheets. However, US government
IOUs have gone from representing 85–90 percent of the Fed’s assets,
to representing 58–60 percent. Notice that the Fed assets have been
growing at a steeper curve rate than the government debt. This may
be because the rate of increase is so high. Citizens and lawmakers
have been pushing back against the steep curve of increasing
government debt (which is all we really see of the exponentially
expanding money system).

Facing resistance to increasing government debt enough to keep
up with the exponentially increasing money supply, the Fed has
turned to creating new money for other private entities. In 1996,
the Fed had no IOUs from others. In 2016, these IOUs from others
represent 41 percent of the total assets. These are IOUs from private
sector financial and corporate entities, some government sponsored
(such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). This category includes all
kinds of arcane financial instruments – mortgage-backed security
bundles, credit swaps, derivatives, purchase agreements with buyback
contracts, sales contracts with repurchase agreements, etc. If you are
interested, the Fed’s financial reports go into quite a bit of detail on
these. Fundamentally, though, they are all taking IOUs and returning
Federal Reserve IOUs (new money) to these financial entities, who are
using these funds to shore up their balance sheets, to game among
themselves, and to buy up the common wealth out from under
everyone.

These activities increase the system’s tendency to transfer wealth from
the many to the few. We see the impact in the dramatically increasing
inequality – the rich are getting radically richer and the number of
poor is exploding.

## Unsustainable

I can’t see any way this system can be sustained. Can you? The system
must change and can change. Chapter 6 looks at the consequences of
our current system. Chapter 7 looks at short-term backwards moves,
bandages and bridges. And Chapter 8 looks at simply done, but
profound change to a sustainable and prosperous system.
