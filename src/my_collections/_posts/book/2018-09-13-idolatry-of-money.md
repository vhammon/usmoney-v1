> _This disposition to admire, and almost to worship, the rich and the powerful,
> and to despise, or, at least, to neglect, persons of poor and mean condition,
> though necessary both to establish and to maintain the distinction of ranks
> and the order of society, is, at the same time, the great and most universal
> cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments._

— Adam Smith, Scottish political economist in his
    1759 _The Theory of Moral Sentiments_<sup>273</sup>

When the rich rule, that which makes them special is deified and
glorified. As a society, we have come to worship money. We embrace
a philosophy that worships capital and capital ownership. We
worship wealthy people, accept their choices as divinely inspired,
and exploit each other to their advantage. The very wealthy have
successfully altered our culture to reflect the value of profit over life
and selfishness over altruism.

Every single day on the top of the news you hear how the market
indexes are faring. This is our guiding light. When stocks are doing
well, our economy is doing well, so we must all be doing well,
right? Those with lots of money are treated with special respect,
consideration and privilege. As the transfer of wealth moved up the
exponential curve of money creation, we have dispensed with the
negative view of conspicuous consumption. The president of the
United States elected in 2016 surrounded himself with gold – walls,
floors, even his toilets – and, many admire that as an indicator
of success.

\## Sacrifice on the altar

Today one in five children goes hungry during the year.<sup>274</sup> One in
seven have developmental issues requiring special help.<sup>275</sup> If any
other nation harmed so many of our children, we would go to war
with them. Instead, politicians claim the regulations and standards
that would keep our children safer would hamper the profit-making
efforts of corporate America. So far, we accept this.

In the US, people work hard and long – 1,770 hrs/year on average in 2014. In France people work about 1,473 and in Germany 1,366 hours.
The Netherlands with the second shortest hours at 1,422 is more
    productive than average.<sup>276</sup> In Switzerland, people work an average 35-hour workweek – and they make more than Americans. European
    countries value rest, recreation and family time.<sup>277</sup>

The US is the only developed country in the world with no legally
mandated vacation time. Every country in Europe has a minimum
mandate of from 25 to 40 days!<sup>278</sup> The research says they are right:
people who are rested and happy are more productive. Vacation days
are important.<sup>279</sup>

We diminish the value of those who dedicate their lives to others
off the money-making grid. We give little value to the non-money
economy of caring for our children, our sick, our elders, or each
other. When these jobs are monetized, we make them some of the
lowest paying jobs, demonstrating our disdain for caregiving. The
US is one the only developing country that does not mandate any
paid maternity leave so parents can bond with their children. New
baby leave is seen as valuing families and an investment in the future
citizens. Thirty-eight countries provide from 5 to 60 days of _paid_
leave for new mothers.<sup>280</sup> In the US, we’ve been convinced businesses
can’t make enough profit if this cost is built into prices. This is a
blind worship of profit-making.

A system that creates money in a different way will reflect a different
set of values: money can be a useful tool benefitting everyone instead
of the idol in the temple of selfishness and greed.
