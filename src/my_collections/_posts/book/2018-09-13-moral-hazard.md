When people are not held accountable for bad behavior, it encourages
more bad behavior. This is called moral hazard. This is one reason
we have laws to punish harmful behavior. However, we deliberately
remove consequences in three basic ways for money creators, and
for money-makers-profit-takers who cause harm to others: systemic
backup and bailout for the bankers (as previously described); a
general corporate liability shield for businesses; and freedom from
prosecution for crime if you are a big enough financial entity.

## Corporate liability shield

When the 1st Bank of the United States was formed, 80 percent
owned by private citizens, the investors were held fully and personally
liable for the bank’s decisions. By the time the 2nd Bank of the US
was formed, the private investors were only liable for up to double
their investment.^281 Today, the private owners of banks, their boards,
and their management are not held personally liable for the banks’
mistakes at all – zip, zero personal responsibility.

This is generally true for any business enterprise under corporate law.
Corporations are created to shield owners, boards and executives
from personal liability for their decisions. There are a few instances
in which people will be held personally accountable for corporate
decisions. However, in general, people who make decisions in any
kind of corporation are protected from personal liability; they are
exempt from consequences for harm-causing decisions, even when
they make deliberate decisions to sacrifice the lives of a few of their
customers – the approach now recommended and taught by many
schools under the patronage of the money power.

The idea is, if executives were personally responsible it would curb
entrepreneurship, risk-taking, and money-making. Yes, it would. It
would shift the burden of consequences back onto the corporation,
instead of privatizing the profits while socializing the risks. It would
require businesses to carefully and independently test a new product
before introducing it into our lives. And it would require executives accept responsibility for their choices. So, if a pharmaceutical CEO
knowingly pushed a drug for unauthorized purposes and people died
as a result, the CEO would face murder or manslaughter charges. A
CEO who thinks he’s worth 500 times his average employee’s salary
is well enough paid to know what is going on in his company, take
responsibility and accept consequences.

Some businesses take advantage of this liability shield to make
money at our expense. Executives willfully decide to ignore unsafe
work conditions, or maintenance on a drill rig, or research that
says their product is killing bees, or causing developmental delays
in children, or changing the climate. They ignore the poisons they
are spewing into the air and rivers, and no individual will be held
accountable, because this is how a _“proper functioning economy works.”_
They make choices that kill you and walk away with their lives and
fortunes intact.

In the very rare instances when a CEO is held accountable,
punishment is not commensurate with the crime. For example,
Massey Energy repeatedly violated mining safety standards –
_knowingly_ putting its employees at risk to increase its profits. CEO
Don Blankenship was fined $250,000 and sentenced to a year in
prison for his role in the deadliest US mine disaster in 40 years –
the Upper Big Branch mine explosion.^282 This may sound like a big
fine, but when he started with Massey in 2000 he was taking home
nearly $6 million a year. He made deliberate decisions that resulted
in the predictable deaths of 29 people and paid a very small price in
time and money. And, the jail time was notably rare for a corporate
executive and a pittance for deliberate manslaughter. In 2018, Don
Blankenship ran for a US Senate seat in West Virginia and got
20 percent of the Republican votes.^283

If corporations are _people,_ why not try the company itself for willful
murder. If the company deserves the death penalty for killing people,
sell the company off to the highest bidder, put the proceeds into
a community fund so stockholders lose their stake, and ban the
executives and board from ever heading a company of more than 10
people again. AND, try the people for manslaughter who deliberately
hide the data about dangers and make decisions that kill.

Here’s another recently publicized example of unpunished criminal
wrongdoing in the name of profit-making: The patent ran out on a
Johnson & Johnson anti-psychotic drug. To hold on to this market
they created a new drug, Risperdal, with a new patent they released in 1994. It wasn’t deemed any better than the old drug, which could now
    be manufactured and sold as a generic, but it was especially good for
    schizophrenia in adults – a small market. J&J wanted a blockbuster,
    billion-dollar drug so they deliberately set out to market it to the
    elderly with dementia and to children with autism – unapproved
    uses, but sadly, increasing _markets._ J&J used corrupt practices to
    essentially bribe gatekeepers and prescribers to order the use of this
    drug. Despite an FDA report of _“an excess number of deaths”_ in the
    elderly taking the drug, and the growth of pendulous breasts in over 5 percent of the children, they continued to market the drug to these
    populations.

The company made about $30 billion in sales of this drug, killing
people and altering lives along the way. The company may pay a total
of $6 billion in settlements and fines for this misconduct, but from
a making-money-is-our-highest-value standpoint, it was worth it;
a $6 billion fine is less than 20 percent of the $30 billion they made
on this one drug alone. With a willingness to kill some consumers,
the corporation made $17.1 billion on adjusted net earnings of $74.3
billion in sales in 2014. And, whatever they pay in fines, they will
deduct it from their earnings before calculating taxes.^284

Alex Gorsky, the man who was in charge of marketing this drug
falsely, was elevated to chief executive of J&J, and earned over $25
million in 2014. It is deeply immoral and repellent that a man who
may have destroyed so many lives is rewarded. But, this is our current
system, and those are the values of this _family_ company.

They are also clearly the values of the GOP. They are slashing
monitoring and enforcement action on corporate wrongdoers to
the nubbins. Public Citizen issued a report in July 2018 showing
that penalties for corporate violations plummeted by double digits
under Trump. _“When it comes to large corporations, the supposedly
‘tough-on-crime’ Trump administration is undertaking an epic retreat from law enforcement – slashing fines, declining to bring cases against
corporate wrongdoers and cutting enforcement programs,”_ said Robert
Weissman, president of Public Citizen. Just to list a few: Department
of Justice penalties against corporations fell 90 percent from $51.5
billion in President Obama’s last year to $4.9 billion in Trump’s
first year. Penalties at the EPA dropped 94 percent, and existing
fines were dropped from $23 billion to $1.4 billion. Nearly every
department tasked with monitoring and assuring safety whacked
its enforcement. Taking a plane? Transportation’s Department
of Aviation Consumer Protection’s penalties are down 11 percent.
Trading on the Commodity Futures Exchange? Enforcement is down
80 percent. Stock market? – Securities and Exchange Commission
down 68 percent. Using consumer products? The Safety Commission
is down 43 percent. And, so on.^285 Beware.

The GOP is as clear as it can be: it believes that if you are in the
business of making money, then you should not be hampered by fear
of consequences for harmful choices. When there are no individual
consequences for corporate choices, immoral, cruel and harmful
behavior gets a free pass. With a focus on short-term profits, harmful
behavior becomes more likely.

While the GOP invites moral hazard, there are exemplary
corporations that look out for their employees, their customers, the
communities in which they prosper, and the environment. Many
businesses have discovered when they make their highest value
contributing a service, while treating employees and customers well,
they make even more money. Patagonia, a clothing manufacturer, is
one such company. Costco is a standout example of this approach.
But lazy, short-sighted and immoral businesses ignore this
opportunity. And, WE, the people have not yet demanded this higher
standard of behavior and responsibility from them all.

Without serious consequences for criminal and immoral behavior, the
bankers and the very rich will continue to take us down the path to
destruction. There is an alternative.
