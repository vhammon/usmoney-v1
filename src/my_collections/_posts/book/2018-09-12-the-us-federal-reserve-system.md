> _The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, provides the nation

– <http://www.federalreserve.gov>

The Federal Reserve Act makes money created by private bankers
using a fractional reserve system our national money. Our money is
a Federal Reserve note – an IOU for future value from the Federal
Reserve’s privately owned member banks, guaranteed by the common
wealth of the United States. The Federal Reserve System (the Fed)
is a banking and money creation system made up of about 3,
privately owned banks (38 percent of total banks). Membership
requires banks purchase shares in the 12 district Federal Reserve banks.
All national banks are required to become members. It is optional for
state and local banks, who must apply and meet requirements. These
12 regional banks function as a central bank with government charter.
The money creation privilege of the Fed’s member banks extends to
all private banks in the US.

## Key elements of our current choice:

Despite the aspirations of the Fed, it does not, has not and cannot
provide a system that is _“safe, flexible and stable”_ – not as currently
mandated.

### Who Decided?

We the people decided, through our duly elected representatives in
the Congress of the United States. In 1913, we passed a law called, _The
Federal Reserve Act._<sup>11</sup> The law was written in 10 days, in secret, by six
bankers on Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia, and then passed
by Congress.<sup>12</sup> As with all fractional reserve money creation systems,
the choice was not made with all the information on the table. It is
fair to say most decision-makers never fully understood the decision
they were making; a review of what they chose to argue about will show this to be true. The arguments are mostly about the role of a
federal government vs. states’ rights, or an-assumed-to-be-controlling
central bank vs. the free market. By now, you should understand that
in a fractional reserve system, the central bank is there to support its
member banks not to control them.

We have modified The Federal Reserve Act several times since 1913.
We have the power to change this law, if and when we decide to make
improvements.

### The Token

The Federal Reserve Act chooses a unit called a dollar for its token.
Roughly 3 percent of the money in use is a physical token we call
cash, including less than one percent in coins. Most cash is a paper
printed to represent different denominations of money. These notes
have been imprinted with information that changed over the years,
reflecting shifts in policy regarding money creation. Immediately
after the law’s passage, these notes were issued with the imprimatur
of many specially chartered state and national banks and labeled
_national currency._

Initially some notes stated the false promise that they were receipt-
money IOUs and could be presented and exchanged for a value of
gold or silver. (The banks issuing these notes were never required to
keep 100% of their promises in gold or silver on hand. The system has
always been fractional reserve.) The text on the note changed over the
years, and now our national money bears the words, _“Federal Reserve
Note  United States of America  This note is legal tender for all debts
public and private.”_

Roughly 97 percent of the money in use is a record of dollar money
units and has no tangible counterpart.

### Authentic & Trustworthy

The Federal Reserve Act makes the money created by the private
banks the legal tender of the United States, giving it authenticity.
The US Secret Service was established in 1865 to suppress the counterfeiting of US currency, and today – funded by taxpayers – it is
responsible for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of our money.
The banks also submit to some standards and oversight from their
central bank to assure trustworthiness, though they mostly write the
standards and the laws to suit themselves and Congress goes along.

The Federal Reserve Act makes our government the ultimate
guarantor of the value of the Federal Reserve System IOUs. From
1913–1970 the Federal Reserve System banks were required to back
their notes with a 5–25 percent reserve of gold or gold certificates, to
support the guarantee from the US government implicit in making
the Federal Reserve Notes the national money.<sup>13</sup>

From 1970 to the present, ownership of a gold reserve has not been
required of the private banks. Today, bank reserves consist of IOUs
from the Federal Reserve system, the US government, or other IOU
assets. Today, our national currency is made trustworthy by a promise
from our nation that we will use our credit and common wealth
when necessary to keep the promises made by the private bank issued
notes. Our money is only as strong as our nation.

### Creation & Destruction

**WHO:** The Federal Reserve Act hands the power to create new
money to the private banking sector. Our national currency consists
of IOUs from these private bankers.

**How is money created?** New money is created when a bank issues a
loan, exchanging a bank system IOU (a Federal Reserve Note) for the
IOU of a borrower. With the exception of more stringent requirements
placed on small local and regional banks, reserves no longer exist in
practice. Capital-equity requirements were substituted for reserves,
but again, the biggest banks are in the 2–4 percent range in practice,
which is a negligible constraint on the creation of new money.

**How is money destroyed?** A physical piece of money like a dollar bill
can be burned or shredded. When it’s just worn out, it is replaced by
a new bill of the same value, which does not change the amount of
money in the supply. But, most money in our current system is an
accounting entry and vanishes when a loan is repaid. When bankers
are confident they turn right around and recreate the money for
someone else, plus more. When bankers are not confident, the money
supply shrinks as loans are repaid and few new loans are issued.

### A Measure & Store of Value

Our chosen system is _by its nature_ an elastic value money system with
an erratically increasing money supply and a continuously declining
money value. Over the last 100 years, our money supply increases
at a rate of 3–11 percent per annum according to official measures,
averaging about 8 percent [(Chapter 5.54).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-5/section-54)

A steadily declining dollar value is how the Fed defines a stable
monetary system. The Federal Reserve Act gives the central bank a
few ineffective powers to limit the private banks’ money creation
so the decline in the value of the dollar remains steady at about
2 percent. Methods of measurement have simply been changed to
keep the reported decrease in value closer to the target.<sup>14</sup> There are no
consequences for failure built into the law.

## A CENTRAL BANK

The Federal Reserve Act establishes 12 regional banks as bankers to
the independent banks in their geographic region. Collectively these
12 regional banks are considered the central bank of the United States.

The Federal Reserve Act establishes a central Board of Governors
with responsibility to set policy and oversee this central banking
system. The members of the Board of Governors are nominated
by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate
for staggered 14 year terms. By law, the appointments must yield
_a “fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and
commercial interests and geographical divisions of the country,”_ and no
two Governors may come from the same Federal Reserve District.<sup>15</sup>
It is assumed that the interests represented are those of the industries’
_owners,_ not those who labor in those industries.

Historically the Wall Street community limits the selection of
Governors to candidates of their choosing. The Government’s right
of appointment is intentionally more a courtesy and window dressing
than any form of influence or control. The bankers need only to
threaten economic discomfort, which is readily within their power
under this law, in order to get their way. This forces the President
to ask, _“Will Wall Street like this appointment?”_ And, somehow,
the politicians and public have been convinced the question is
appropriate.

The central bank is there to supply transfer services to the private
member banks, to facilitate borrowing and lending of reserves
between the banks, and to act as a lender of last resort to the banks
when they cannot get help from each other (creating money for
them). The central bank sets the interest rate at which it will lend/
create money for its member banks. This power influences how
much money the private banks will create, because they borrow it to
establish the anchor for their own lending/money creation, either as
a reserve or as high quality equity. But as noted, the requirement for
reserves and equity is so small, this power of the central bank is one
of slight influence not of direct containment.

The law makes the Regional Reserve Bank of New York the biggest
and most powerful of the regional Federal Reserve banks. The NY
Fed is the banker to the US Government and the agent for the
Federal Reserve System’s Board of Governors. The Fed creates new
money by making loans to our government when tax revenues are
inadequate to pay our expenses and brokers sales of US Government
debt in the marketplace. In a reserve system, having all of the
deposits of the largest employer, tax collector, and biggest spender in
your vault, is a profitable gift.

In 1913, the citizens of the US _married_ the private banking sector,
giving them the power to create money for the nation. Divorce is
an option.

**So, how does the Federal Reserve System understand its job?**
