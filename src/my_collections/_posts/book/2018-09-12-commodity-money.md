> _Observe well these rules: It is a very common mistake to say that money is
> a commodity...Bullion is valued by its weight...money is valued by its stamp._

– John Locke, An Essay on Money & Bullion, 1718<sup>1</sup>

Commodity money is defined by the physical nature of the token.
The physical token is only one aspect, sometimes minor, of a money
system, so this is a bit like classifying quilts by the binding, or cars
by their tires – not particularly useful. But, because the nature of the
token is of overriding concern to many authorities, let’s review the
concept of commodity money.

People have used an astounding list of commodities for money –
seashells, tobacco, salt, spices, grains, precious metals. However, gold
and silver are what most people think of when they think commodity
money. For simplicity, I’ll use gold as my example. The principles that
apply to gold commodity money, apply to all commodity money.

Commodity money refers to a money system in which the token is
a commodity with a value of its own in the marketplace. This is its
physical and conceptual defining characteristic, and this simplicity
may be part of its appeal. However, commodity money is not pure
and simple money; a commodity money does double duty. It has a
value as a currency and a value in the commodity market. This has
advantages for some people and disadvantages for others.

This double duty adds a gaming layer to the marketplace. A
marketplace decision is not only about the producer and the
consumer; it is about who can juggle the changing value of the
money to their advantage. Commodity money gives advantage and
privilege to some and distorts the marketplace. Potential power and
glory in gaming the market may be part of its appeal.

There have been no 100% commodity money systems in widespread
primary use for at least 700 years – if ever. If _primary use by everyone_ in a society means for all their buying and selling exchanges, then a
100% commodity money system has rarely existed.

It is most likely when gold coins were in service, they functioned as
cash does today – for everyday expenditures, as a measure of value
on accounts, and for settling accounts by paying the difference of
positive and negative transfers. Money in use, reflected by the give
and take on account, was probably much more than the quantity
of cash coins. The cash coins served as a standard measure of value
though, even when not in use.

Historically, the premium metal moneys – gold and silver – have
primarily been a medium of exchange amongst the wealthy who
used them to settle accounts they kept with purveyors of goods
and services or to make significant purchases. Ordinary people
generally used lesser metals, primarily of value by fiat of the ruler, or
maintained accounts of trade that may have been settled with a cash
payment or with a payment in kind.

## Money and not money

Once long, long ago, gold only had value as a commodity used for
jewelry and luxury goods. This value would have gone up and down
with the supply and demand for gold in the marketplace – and
goldsmiths probably paid for it with IOU chits for grains and cattle.
Or, there was no marketplace for gold and it was entirely controlled
by the rulers.

Once gold became a commodity chosen to be used as money, it now
had two values: its value based on the supply and demand of the
commodity, and the value based on the supply and demand for gold
coin. Gold money had to serve two masters: the marketplace for gold,
and the need for money itself. In the commodity marketplace, its
value was determined by the available supply, the cost of production,
and by how much was needed for industry, medicine, adornment,
etc. However, the value of gold money also changed according to
how much was available for use as money, and how much was needed — which can be manipulated by those who have great sums of it or
    those who own the mines.

Using gold as money has nearly vanished, though there is a
movement to bring it back [(Chapter 7.78).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-7/section-78) Gold coins are produced
primarily as commemoratives by public and private entities, and
used as a store of wealth. Commemorative coins today are like any
asset in the market: the gold miners and the coin producers pay their
expenses and mark up the coins to make a profit. And the speculators
trade and trade again, running up the price. That becomes the market
value of the coins. As such, they are the same as any tangible asset
purchased as a means of storing value. One person might buy a quilt,
another might buy a stash of gold coins or bullion, another might
buy cases of Scotch or barrels of oil.

There are vast stores of gold bullion – mostly in national ownership
and storage – considered part of the common wealth of assets that
back up national currencies and that may be used to settle accounts
as a transfer of wealth. None of these forms of stashed wealth are
being used as money.

There have been systems that used receipts for gold or other
commodities as money, but remember, using a receipt is different
from using the commodity itself. As we have moved into a global
web-entrenched economy, where transactions happen at the speed
of light, it seems unlikely we will revert to carrying around pockets
of any kind of coin – although the doomsayers think it will come in
handy when we run ourselves over the cliff into dissolution and chaos.
I read once though, you will have better fortune with a store of good
whiskey or seeds than with gold. Remember the story of Midas – we
can’t eat gold.

When gold is used, those who are the closest to its transformation
into new money (mine owners, merchants and rulers), and those
with great wealth have a decided advantage in manipulating an
exchange to their benefit. Gold and other commodities cannot be a
neutral medium of exchange. In a commodity money system, there is
justification for the corrupted Golden Rule: _he who has the gold rules._

## A gold, 100% commodity money

Remember, if it is only individuals exchanging gold in some form,
then it is not money: it is barter or indirect barter. Community-wide
agreement to use gold as money, and transferable use would make
gold a commodity money.

### Who Decides

#### HOW IS COMMUNITY-WIDE AGREEMENT ACHIEVED?

Any kind of government, from dictator to democracy, can choose to
use commodity money.

### The Token

#### A COMMODITY.

Throughout history many commodities have been used for money,
from shells to tobacco and metals. Out of this wide variety of
commodities, gold, silver and copper have been the commodities that
have risen to the top of the useful and used list, and they have always
had a strong commodity value in the marketplace. Coins are the
preferred form of precious metal money tokens. Because metal coins
are durable, whereas account ledgers are not, the abundance of coins
has resulted in a lopsided view of their historical importance.

Curiously, the first metal coins were not valued as commodities in
their own right; they were a more durable and convenient form of
IOU or receipt for other consumable commodities, like cattle or grains.

### Authentic & Trustworthy

Commodity money has two layers of authenticity and
trustworthiness: as the coin of the realm and as a commodity.

As the coin of the realm or legal tender, the agreement to use a
commodity across a wide community was guaranteed by whoever was in political power and issued the coins – individuals of great wealth
and standing, merchants, banks, churches, temples, or governments.
Coins often bore a stamp of the person guaranteeing their value.
These coins could be used to pay tribute or taxes to the ruler or could
be used to make purchases, their value guaranteed by the issuer of
the coin.

A commodity token has a secondary guarantee of trustworthiness
and continuing value – its commodity value in the marketplace.
This backup value is one of its chief attractions. Some believe gold
is the best or _natural_ money, because it has this tangible commodity
backup value.

A gold coin is valuable in the present in a tangible form: it represents
equity. With a small investment in equipment anyone can determine
the quality and weight of gold. Anyone can create a coin from
gold, and with the weight of their reputation for trustworthiness,
guarantee it is of a certified purity and weight. And, whatever the
value as coin, in a pinch one could melt down the coin into bullion
and sell it at market value for the metal. My ancestor, John Higley
of Granby Connecticut, owned a copper mine and issued his own
coins for spending in his community (1737–1739). Higley Coppers, as
the coins are called, are rare today and a collector’s item. They varied
considerably in mass, from 122 to 170 grains of copper, probably not
an uncommon characteristic of privately struck coinage.<sup>2</sup>

### Measure of Value

When gold and precious metal commodity money systems were in
use, they played an important role in developing money as a measure
of value in the marketplace.

For millennia, gold was a standard measure of value against which
the value of money was set. This provided a basis for exchanges of
international currencies. This did not necessarily mean the money
itself was commodity money.

Most of us have weaned ourselves from using gold as a comparable
measure; it is not something we buy and sell enough for it to have a value as such. But, in the early development of money systems, gold
played an important role as a yardstick for establishing a measure
of value.

#### AN ELASTIC MEASURE

Gold and silver are elements of limited availability with multiple
uses in the marketplace. This means the value grows as the supply
dwindles in proportion to the demand. Current estimates are that
from the beginning of history we have extracted about 170,000 tons
of gold, and there are perhaps another 50,000 tons still to be mined.
It is hard to really know, but we know there is a limit to the supply
and we know demand is growing.<sup>3</sup>

This means a golden measuring stick will shrink – a smaller and
smaller bit of gold will have greater and greater value. A gold money
system is intrinsically an elastic value system that steadily increases
the value of the coin, or shrinks the amount of gold in it.

A gold money supply is vulnerable to market supply and demand,
which makes its value go up and down for non-monetary reasons.
During certain periods of conquest and exploitation, the supply of
gold increased dramatically, significantly altering the available money
supply and the value of money – and consequently, all activity in
national and global economies. At other times, people of great wealth
hoarded gold, or sent it off as bullion to a place where it had a higher
market value.

These changes in supply altered gold’s value as money and destabilized
economies. During periods when gold coins were in use, central
powers tried to control the mining and supply of gold to keep the
supply and value stable. Governments sought to lessen the impact of
hoarding or melting coins into bullion by setting a legal value for the
coinage slightly higher than the commodity value.

However, the historical evidence says these government imposed
remedies haven’t worked very well; whatever the controls, they could
be gamed to the advantage of the wealthy few.

### Store of Wealth

Increasing value, easy portability, and ready convertibility to currency
or goods, are great attributes of an asset that can be stored over
time or distance. These same attributes make gold an excellent and
appreciating store of wealth, which is one of the functions of money.
Those who can afford to store gold will have the advantage of a long-
term guaranteed increase in value for their gold holdings. As a high
value asset, gold bullion has been used to settle international trade
imbalances and to provide a readily convertible guarantee for the
trustworthiness of a sovereign currency.

When we compare the increasing value of 100% gold money to a
money system that deliberately decreases the value of its currency,
gold money looks like a superior system. Just keep in mind storing
value is only one of the functions of money – and not its most
important function. Real assets can store value just as well, leaving
money available for exchanges. What is good about an asset held for
long term wealth storage or for speculation is not necessarily the best
choice for a medium of exchange.

### Creation & Destruction

#### CREATION

Gold money gives this power of creation to those who own or control
the mines and those with stores of gold. Making gold coins requires
production costs, so those who create and issue the coins take the
seignorage – the difference between the cost of production and the
value of the coins. To reduce the power of mine owners and those
with great wealth over the supply of money when gold is used as part
of a money system, governments have often restricted the ownership
of mines, or constrained the ownership of gold in some way.
However, new gold supplies are dwarfed by existing supplies, which
mostly rest in the hands of world powers and the wealthy few.

Historically, nearly all new gold came into being through conquest,
genocide, and the power of great wealth and armies. A tantalizing smattering of individuals striking it rich by panning or mining for
gold adds a false luster to the historical realities. If we switched to a
100% gold money system, these wealthy individuals and governments
that own the mines, and own the world’s stocks of gold bullion,
would control the supply available for currency, hence the value of
the coins, and consequently the cost of everything in the marketplace.

#### WHO DESTROYS MONEY OR REMOVES IT FROM CIRCULATION AND HOW IS THAT DONE?

Gold coins can be removed by melting them into bullion and using
it for one of gold’s many commercial or industrial purposes. It
can be hoarded by those with great wealth, removing it from the
circulating supply.

Demonstrating the difficulty of a commodity based money, Colonial
Virginia and Maryland made tobacco a legal tender in 1633. But in
1639 there was a bumper crop and the colonial assemblies ordered
half of the crop to be burned – a good example of how a money’s
commodity basis can interfere with its function as money.<sup>4</sup>

## Ultimately, who rules?

Wealth and power rule. Historically, the broader market value of gold
(and all commodity monies) has been established, manipulated and
exploited by those who have the greatest wealth, which gives them
the power to rule.

Commodity money is not a neutral medium of exchange. There
cannot be a free market when a small, privileged group can control
the value of the medium of exchange, taking what profits they deem
reasonable, and controlling the supply.

In practice, this double duty as commodity and as money makes it
first-rate money if you believe people with power and wealth should
have privileges and advantages others do not have. It is second-
rate money if you believe a level (equal opportunity) playing field
promotes the best play.
