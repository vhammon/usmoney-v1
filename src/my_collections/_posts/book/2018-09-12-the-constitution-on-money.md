Not all of our founding fathers fully understood the importance of
money creation to their vision for America – a nation of, by and for
the people, and thus failed to make the money creation power crystal
clear in the Constitution.

## Is our money system Constitutional?

What does our Constitution have to say about the creation of money?
Not enough. Here’s what relates to money from the Constitution:

> _We the People of the United States, **in Order to form a more perfect
> Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for
> the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the
> Blessings of Liberty** to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish
> this Constitution for the United States of America...._
>
> _Article I, Section 8_
>
> **The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes,**
>
> _ Duties,Imposts and Excises, _
>
> **to pay the Debts and provide for the common
> Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties,
> Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;**
>>
> **To borrow Money on the credit of the United States;
> To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the
> several States...**
> **TO COIN MONEY,**
>
> _regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and
> fix the standard of Weights and Measures;...> _
>
> **To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for
> carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers**
>
> _vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any
> Department or Officer thereof._
>
> _Article 1, Section 10_
>
> **No State shall...coin money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing
> but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts;...**
>
> _Amendment XIV, SECTION 4_
>
> **The validity of the public debt of the United States,**
>
> _authorized by law,including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion,_
>
> **shall not be questioned....**
> _Amendment XIV, Section 5_
> _The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the
> provisions of this article._

There are only two specific references to money in the Constitution:
_“Congress shall have the power ...to coin Money...”_ and, _“No State shall...
coin money; emit Bills of Credit; make anything but gold and silver Coin
a Tender in Payment of Debts;...”_ Combined, these seem to imply that
only gold and silver coin, created by the federal government can be
money. However, that has never been the interpretation.

### Word definitions

We can look at these sections of the Constitution from the
perspective of the people who wrote them in 1787, and from our
understanding of the world today. What did “To coin” mean to the
framers of the Constitution? Samuel Johnson’s popular dictionary
of 1755,<sup>9</sup> gives these definitions for the noun coin: (I’ve added the
bold type.)

**COIN,** _noun. 1. Money stamped with a legal impression.; 2. _**Payment of
any kind.**_
_**COIN,**_ verb. 1. To mint or stamp metals for money; and 2. to make or gorge
anything.
_**COINAGE.**_ 1. the act or practice of coining money; 2. Coin; _**money; stamped
and legitimated metal;**_ 3. The charges of coining money.. Forgery; invention._

Curiously, although this dictionary uses the word money in 69
entries, it does not define money itself.

Reflecting the prevalent understanding of the era, here’s what Daniel
Webster’s Dictionary of 1828<sup>10</sup> said fifty years later:

**COIN,** _noun Primarily, the die employed for stamping money. Hence, 1._ **Money
stamped;**_ a piece of metal, as gold, silver, copper, or other metal, _**converted
into money, by impressing on it marks, figures or characters.... 3.
That which serves for payment.**
**COIN,** _verb transitive, 1. To stamp a metal, and convert it into money; to mint. ..._
**MONEY,** _noun plural moneys. 1. Coin; stamped metal; any piece of metal,
usually gold, silver or copper, stamped by public authority, and used as the
medium of commerce. We sometimes give the name of money to other coined
metals, and to any other material which rude nations use as a medium of trade.
But among modern commercial nations, gold, silver and copper are the only
metals used for this purpose. Gold and silver, containing great value in small
compass, and being therefore of easy conveyance, and being also durable
and little liable to diminution by use, are the most convenient metals for coin
or_ **money which is the representative of commodities of all kinds,
of lands, and of every thing that is capable of being transferred
in commerce. 2. Bank notes or bills of credit issued by authority,
and exchangeable for coin or redeemable, are also called money;
as such notes in modern times represent coin, and are used as a
substitute for it.** _If a man pays in hand for goods in bank notes which are
current, he is said to pay in ready money._
**DOLLAR,** _noun \[G.] A silver coin of Spain and of the United States, of the value
of one hundred cents, or four shillings and sixpence sterling. The dollar seems
to have been originally a German coin, and in different parts of Germany, the
name is given to coins of different values._

From Webster’s definitions, two things are apparent:

1. Webster didn’t fully understand money, and so, it’s likely
   neither did most people. Apparently he thought the money
      system was a 100% commodity + receipt for commodity
      system – and bills of credit were exchangeable for coin. We
   know nearly all Western money systems for the past 800 years
   have been fractional reserve systems, so Webster’s prevalent
   view was a misleading misunderstanding, not the reality.
2. The noun and the verb forms of coin were used for _“that
   which serves for payment”_ – in other words for money by
   broad definition.

So what does the Constitution authorize in regards to money?

## To coin that which serves for payment

The Constitution says Congress has the power _“To borrow Money on
the credit of the United States.”_ This clearly authorizes Congress to
borrow existing money guaranteed by America’s full faith and credit.
But, does it also mean Congress can issue IOUs that will be used as
money? The founders were clearly aware bills of credit were a form
of money and a form of borrowing. The Articles of Confederation
more clearly authorized Congress to issue bills of credit to be used
as money and they did. They issued the Continentals that won
the Revolutionary War for us. But, the Constitution leaves out the
clear phrasing that was in the Articles of Confederation authorizing
Congress to emit bills of credit that would be used as money. This left
the door open for private interests to create our money.

The Constitution says Congress has the power _“To coin Money,
regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard
of Weights and Measures.”_ Were the founders using the words coin
money to refer to creating anything that serves for payment? If we
examine the original intent of the authors of the Constitution, we
must look at their ideas about money.

For the founders who wanted common wealth money, to coin meant
creating anything that serves for payment. But, the founders who
believed only gold and silver could be true money, undoubtedly
meant to limit the government to literally stamping metal coins for
money. Some of these gold and silver advocates intended the federal
government to have the power to create the only money, some
intended the private bankers to have this power.

However, the more savvy financial interests, who knew then as they
know now that metal coins are only a tiny portion of money in use,
may have quite deliberately meant to limit government to creating
this small portion of our money. They were preserving the privilege of
the private banks to create most of our money in the form of private
bankers’ bills of credit, by leaving out the specific wording in the

Articles of Confederation that gave the federal government the power
to issue bills of credit.

To add to the lack of clarity in the Constitution, Article 1, Section
10 bans states from coining money, or emitting bills of credit (a
form of money). And, in a seeming contradiction, it forbids states
from making anything but gold and silver coin legal tender. This
compounds the confusion.

**No State shall...coin money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing
but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; ....**

If in every State, only gold and silver coin can be used as legal tender
and only Congress has the power to coin money, this section appears
to reserve the right to create money to the federal government and to
limit money to gold and silver coins. However, that has never been
the applied law; the law has always acknowledged coins and bills of
credit (bank notes) as forms of money. So, what does this section in
the Constitution mean?

Facing the confusion in the Constitution, Congress and the Supreme
Court have decided the federal government has the power to create
our money and to sub-contract out the privilege to the private sector.
I wonder whether anyone has challenged whether Congress should
be able to hand off this money-creation power to private entities. It
gives those entities an unfair advantage in the economy. Section 8
of the Constitution reads, “but, all duties, imposts and excises shall be
uniform throughout the United States.” How can there be uniformity
when some have special privilege and their money is worth more in
the marketplace? And others must use money that carries a burden of
debt-interest?

Then there is the equal protection clause of the Constitution, at the
end of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment:

> _No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or
> immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person
> within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws._

When an elite group of people create money for the nation, this
privilege gives them rights and protections under the law not granted
to the rest of the population. They can protect their personal interests
in a way that is not subject to a level playing-field, equal-under-
the-law free market. All Americans do not have _“equal protection of
the laws.”_

How can it be Constitutional to give private banks the privilege and
power to create our money?

**So, how did we end up a nation that borrows its own money,
based on our own credit, at interest, from private bankers?**
