Before we discuss the money systems prevailing over most of the past
millennium, let’s make the distinction between a money system and
a financial system. Nearly all money systems today are entangled
with banking and finance. So, it’s worth spending a few pages to be
clear about what are the functions of banking-finance, and what are
monetary functions.

The money system is about what will be money – What money
system will be used? Who creates and extinguishes money? What will
be the token? How will it be created? Who will give the money of
choice the imprimatur of trust and stability. Who will put it in and
take it out of an economy? How will they do that?

Banking, on the other hand, is about financial services: safe storage
of your money, secure transfer services, keeping accounts of all the
transfers, serving as an intermediary between savers and borrowers,
and investment packaging. It is helpful to keep banking and
monetary functions distinct, because the service of money creation
and the bank services do not need to be provided by the same entity
in a system. That’s just the current choice we have made.

## Basic bank

A basic deposit bank fills several functions.

### Safe storage

A bank takes deposits and stores your money for you. Typically you
have two basic choices: a checking, or transaction account, or some
kind of long-term savings like a certificate of deposit (CD). In a
transaction account your money is available on demand. In a CD,
you commit to letting the bank keep your money for a specified
period of time. A bank keeps accounts of the money you have stored.

### Transfer services

A bank transfers your money for you when you buy or sell and
provides security for these transfers. You write a check, use a
debit card, or give online instructions, and the bank takes care of
transferring money from your account to the seller’s account, no
matter where the seller banks. A bank keeps records of your transfers
in and out of your account.

### Intermediary

The bank takes money from savers and loans it to borrowers. When
you put your money into long-term savings (a CD), you are loaning
your money to the bank, knowing it will turn around and loan it out
to someone else as an investment and share the profits with you. The
bank’s role is due diligence: appraising risk and credit worthiness.
These bank loans earn interest for the bank and the saver.

## Investment bank

A traditional investment bank fills another function.

### Intermediary for investors and investments

An investment bank gathers funds from those who have money to
invest, and invests in new enterprises that carry varying levels of
risk. The investment bank’s job is due diligence in researching and
reporting the level of risk, and in matching investors with appropriate
levels of risk.

**And, just like money system options, either of these banking
options can be privately owned or government owned,
unregulated or regulated – depending on the values of the
community choosing them.**
