Life is full of the unexpected. And as the saying goes, _Shit Happens._
Extreme weather, bugs, blights, and disease happen. Even too much
of a good thing can create devastating and unpredicted hard times.

In the natural world, diversity and redundancy are keys to survival.
(I use the term redundancy in the sense of having a backup
system for emergencies – think of space shuttles with multiple
redundancies: if one system fails, another kicks in). Nature provides
many backup systems. For example, thousands of varieties of maize
naturally evolved in Central and South America to thrive in certain
microclimates. If one variety was killed off by blight, many others
remained to stabilize the food supply for the broad population.

However, modern agriculture, in the interest of efficiency and
profitability, plants huge fields with a single crop. While this practice
increases short-term profits, it is not resilient; one blight can wipe out
the entire crop. Using chemical fertilizers and pesticides to protect
the crop merely postpones the inevitable collapse, kills pollinators,
destroys topsoil, and creates health problems in the process. On the
other hand, a resilient farm, one that plants many crops in rotation,
is less efficient. Finding the right balance between efficiency and
diversity-redundancy is important for long-term survival.

In any system, there is an inverse relationship between efficiency,
diversity and resiliency: to increase efficiency, redundancy and
diversity must decrease. Cutting back on diversity and redundancy
makes a system more efficient, but cut back too far and the system
loses resiliency, becoming vulnerable and unsustainable. When
a community springs up around a single major employer, what
happens when the big employer shuts down? My home state of
Oregon is littered with ghost towns that were once thriving mining,
timber or stone quarries. Michael Moore’s film _Roger & Me_ (1989)
documented such a regional impact when General Motors shut down several auto plants in Flint, Michigan in 1992.^9 The city is still struggling to recover.

Monopolies are changing life in America. Big franchises are displacing
small local businesses, effectively gutting Main Street. Amazon
has taken over sales of nearly everything, reducing prices with the
efficiency of scale. Mergers and acquisitions continue to reduce the
number of business owners from many to a few. And when the five
biggest banks that control more than half of all the banking assets in
the US gambled recklessly, they tanked our economy.

It is not always easy to decide where the right balance lies between
profit-making efficiency and life-sustaining diversity-redundancy.
Individuals tend to look out for their immediate and personal
self-interest, which often pushes toward efficiency and highest short-
term profits. Society as a whole, the WE, must demand diversity,
redundancy and survival for our communities, our nation and our
species. Government is how WE make decisions for the whole – and
government must stand up for long-term survival.

Our current money system is highly efficient and extremely
vulnerable to collapse, requiring increasingly extraordinary measures
to keep it functioning. A collapse of our financial system will utterly
cripple our entire economy. This does not need to happen.

Keep this balance of efficiency and redundancy in mind when you
think about the best money system for our Nation.
