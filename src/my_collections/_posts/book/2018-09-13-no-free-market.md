The people with the power to create our money and rule say they
believe in a free market. They invest billions to promote their idea
of a free market, which shouldn’t be necessary if the idea is truly
beneficial to all. The evidence suggests they mean a market in which
the rich act freely to exploit everyone else.

## What is a ‘free’ market?

People prosper when they are free to choose a work life that makes
the best of their gifts and gives them a sense of purpose. People
prosper when they can create products, services, and businesses that
bring them satisfaction and wealth. People prosper when they are
free to buy what is freely offered. Businesses succeed when they meet
consumers’ needs. A free market is about keeping the ownership
of business in the private sector, allowing businesses to make and
sell what they can, and giving consumers the freedom to buy what
they want.

However, based on this premise, some say we should each be free
to define our responsibilities to others, to the environment, and to
society as we see fit. We should be free from standards, rules, and
regulations imposed by government. This corrupts what is otherwise
a reasonable idea. In order for free enterprise to work for the general
welfare there must be a balance of freedom and responsibility.
Because human nature is always at various stages of development,
including moral development, not everyone will make responsible
decisions. For many, stuck at the stage of _“it’s all about ME & MINE,”_
shortsightedness and greed will harm the community unless there are
standards, rules, regulations, and enforcement.

We are also relatively easy to manipulate. Douglas Rushkoff, in
his book, _Coercion; Why we listen to what ‘they’ say_ (1999), details
a fascinating litany of how we are readily manipulated in the
marketplace.^263 Retailers invest billions to find ways to get you to
spend, carefully designing stores and displays to generate impulse
sales and increase profits. Laws can counterbalance manipulation by
requiring full product information and disclosure of risks.

The core idea of a free market – and of a democracy – is that
aggregating many choices will serve the market and community
best. However, to make this premise valid, there are important
requirements. The people making choices and decisions in the
marketplace must be informed, diverse, and independent. This is
true whether we’re talking political decision-making or marketplace
decisions.

### Informed

In the marketplace, the consumer must be informed. We’ve made
progress in getting information onto packaging about what’s in our
food and home products. We’ve passed laws to improve labeling on
menus, improve nutrition information on foods and, in 2016, to
require GMO labeling.^264

It’s an uphill battle against the money power, who know that an
informed public may not choose cheap-to-make, money-making
foods and personal care products that include harmful ingredients.
For example, more money can be made with a product that has a
long shelf life. Twinkies were re-engineered in 2013 to extend their
shelf life from 26 to 45 days. While many will not be deterred from
eating a sweet with 36 ingredients (mostly chemical constructs),
others will avoid these products when they are informed about the
impact of those chemicals on our bodies. And, while that cuts into
the profits of an existing company, it gives someone the opportunity
to make a better and more desirable product.^265 266 Unfortunately, the
existing companies are the ones with the political power to block laws
that would inform customers.

### Diverse & Independent

Diversity and independence in a marketplace require many small
businesses, with many different approaches vying for your dollars. We
struggle to maintain this today. Today in nearly every industry, we
have a handful of giant corporations who set the market’s direction
and determine consumer choices. Anti-trust laws, passed to protect
us from collusion, price-fixing and controlling monopolies, are rarely
enforced.

### Free to make money

Today, most free market advocates are not really arguing for a free
marketplace; they are arguing for giving the owners of capital free
rein/reign to make as much money as they can at any expense to
the community. The freedom to exploit people by paying wages
impossible to live on, to exploit common wealth natural resources
for short-term gain, and to hide information about food safety, are
considered some of the divine rights of capital. Free market advocates
are not even shy about promoting the idea that killing a few people
with unsafe products is part of the noble free enterprise system.

From just 2005 to 2014, the Charles Koch Foundation doled out
nearly $108 million to colleges and universities to promote _laissez-
faire_ economics – low taxes, minimal regulations on business. In 2008,
Florida State University made an agreement with this foundation
that gives the foundation a say in the curriculum and hiring decisions
of the University. The Koch funding established a Program for
Excellence in Economic Education within the Stavros Center for the
Advancement of Free Enterprise and Economic Education, part of
the economics department.^267

The Stavros Center promotes _Common Sense Economics: What
Everyone Should Know About Wealth and Prosperity_ (2005), by James D.
Gwartney, Richard L. Stroup and Dwight R. Lee.^268 The university
has an entire economics program by this name. And this free-market-
focused text book is accompanied by course materials for economics
teachers all the way down to the kindergarten level. Endowment
funds spread this curriculum to elementary and high schools.

The text book, _Common Sense Economics_ makes no mention of
the power of the private sector to create our nation’s money. Any
economics textbook ignoring this fundamental and foundational
economic factor is suspect, and this particular textbook is a gross
distortion of a free AND responsible marketplace. It is discouraging
when a few men can and do use their extraordinary wealth to corrupt
economics education throughout the nation.

Here is one selection from the Foundation for Economic Education
website: Sacrificing Lives for Profits by Common Sense Economics
co-author Dwight Lee. It argues we’d be better off if companies cut
corners, even risking customers’ lives, in the name of profit. He says,

_The charge that sways juries and offends public sensitivities...is that greedy
corporations sacrifice human lives to increase their profits. Is this charge true?
Of course it is. But this isn’t a criticism of corporations; rather it is **a reflection of
the proper functioning of a market economy. Corporations routinely
sacrifice the lives of some of their customers to increase profits, and
we are all better off because they do.** That’s right, we are lucky to live in
an economy that allows corporations to increase profits by intentionally selling
products less safe than could be produced. The desirability of sacrificing lives
for profits may not be as comforting as milk, cookies and a bedtime story, but
it follows directly from a reality we cannot wish away._

_The reality is scarcity. There are limits to the desirable things that can be produced.
If we want more of one thing, we have to do with less of other things.” **(Bold
added for emphasis.)**^269_

So, a child who dies in a poorly designed car helps the market
economy function. Lee makes the argument that if, for instance,
we require an auto manufacturer to install seat belts, that will add
to the cost of a car and you will have less to spend on other things.
He claims free enterprise is looking out for your choices and your
money. Nowhere does this curriculum argue that businesses have an
obligation to fully inform their customers about the level of risk and
their options.

Faux-free marketers argue that adults should be able to choose their
own levels of risk-taking. But, then they argue against testing for
levels of risk, and against informing the public of those risks. The
public cannot make an informed choice.^270

The argument is that if pesky government just stays out of setting
safety standards, you would be free to choose a cheaper unsafe car - your choice determined by the effectiveness of advertising, which is not required to tell you whether the car is safe. The manufacturer
makes higher profits on cheaper cars, and you save money you can
spend elsewhere until you die early in an automobile accident. See?
It’s win-win. It’s just part of the market economy. Easy profits are
more important than the deaths of those who die unnecessarily
without seat belts. According to the CDC, 13,000 people were saved
by a seatbelt, and another 4,000 would have lived if they’d worn
theirs in 2009 alone.^271 Author Dwight Lee thinks their deaths are a
worthy sacrifice on the altar of lazy profits and _a proper functioning
market economy._

This tells us, it’s not about a market in which the customer is free-to-
choose; it’s about a free-to-make-as-much-money-as-possible market
for business. And again, this pseudo-free market argument assumes
our businesses are too stupid to make safe cheap cars _and_ a profit. On
the issue of safety belts, even though faux-free-marketeers gave it their
best, genuine common sense prevailed. Our auto makers rose to the
challenge and we have safer _and_ cheaper cars.

The other half of their argument is that scarcity is real. Yes, it is. We
can’t have everything we want. But, that does not mean that we must
choose between one unsafe product and another. This is the same
thinking that Tufts University’s nutrition program used to justify
their good food check on Froot Loops. They said if parents have to
choose between a candy bar and Froot Loops, then Froot Loops are
the right choice. There are other choices.

The level of iniquitous thinking in the _Common Sense Economics’_
premise that killing some people is just part of a well-functioning
free market is jaw-dropping – especially when you consider these
men have the money to push this thinking into our institutes of
learning, our Judiciary, Executive Branch and Congress. The book
spouts the propaganda of a greedy and lazy money power as if it is
sacred doctrine: low taxes, limited government, free enterprise, the
importance of unrestricted freedom for the money powers, without
any references to community responsibility and protecting citizens
from the unscrupulous.

## Blackmail

### Wall Street

There is no free market when a single sector of the economy can
blackmail the rest into doing its bidding. Our financial sector has
this power, and exercises it. On a day-to-day basis, our decision-
makers must consider what Wall Street will think of any policy
decisions. And, in times of crisis, the bankers threaten to take the
entire economy down if they are not given a save. We now submit to
making bank and big business profits our nation’s highest imperative - and to hell with the common wealth.

### Mainstreet

Today there are over 100,000 private family foundations with assets
of over $800 billion, using their power of the dole to manipulate
elections, government policy, educational curriculums and grassroots
policy campaigns.^272 If you don’t promote or teach or what they want,
you won’t have enough funding to survive. This is blackmail, too –
and far from a free marketplace of ideas.

## ‘ISMS

### Capitalism

With wariness I’ll touch briefly on capitalism. The concept of
capitalism often goes hand in hand with free-market advocacy. Again,
capitalism and free market are terms requiring a definition with every
use, because they are often conflated, confused or polluted with other
concepts.

Google defines capitalism as, _“an economic and political system in
which a country’s trade and industry are controlled by private owners for
profit, rather than by the state.”_ What this definition leaves out is the
importance of the money-creation power, which will determine how
capital, hence capitalism works in practice. Since whoever has the
privilege and power to create money will rule, there can be no free market when the privilege of money creation and all the power that
bestows belongs to a tiny elite.

For many capitalism includes the concept of wealthy people creating
a nation’s money. When they advocate for capitalism, they are
advocating for private ownership of industry, the profit motive, and
for the right of capital owners to create a nation’s money. Their
policy choices demonstrate a belief in what can be called predatory
capitalism – capitalism that allows a small elite to prey on and devour
as much wealth as they can to sustain their status, no matter the cost
to those in the rest of the economy.

However, private ownership of industry and profit-making is easily
tweezed apart from the process of money creation and exploitation.
A simple amendment to the Google definition changes capitalism
from predatory to partnership. Add _“...controlled by private owners for
profit and for community well-being.”_ With this definition we have
the benefits of capitalism, a truly free market, and the benefits of a
healthy community.

### Socialism

And, with equal trepidation, I’ll touch briefly on socialism – another
term that is widely misunderstood and misused. Dictionary
definitions don’t even agree. Here’s one from Merriam-Webster,

_1. any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or
governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and
    distribution of goods; 2.a: a system of society or group living in which there is
    no private property; b: a system or condition of society in which the means of
    production are owned and controlled by the state._

This definition comes closest to the authoritarian socialism-
communism of the 20th century.

Here’s the definition that shows up front and center on Google: _“a
political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that
the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or
**regulated** by the community as a whole.”_

These definitions allow for night and day. There is a significant
difference between owning, controlling, or administering, and
regulating. This second definition leaves a very wide range of
possibilities from owned and controlled to simply regulated.
Some people are using _socialism_ to refer to a system in which the
community as a whole, through a government of, by, and for the
people, opt to create a solid foundation for all their citizens and still
have a free market. They believe that standards, rules, regulations,
monitoring, and accountability are all part of the foundation for a
truly free market – one that respects all participants. This is closest
to the late 20th early 21st century models of governance in northern
European _socialist_ countries today.

Ask what people mean when they refer to either capitalism or
socialism. And, then ask, who they believe should have the power
to create money, because that will determine how ANY version of
capitalism or socialism works out in practice.

### True freedom

True freedom and a free market require information and the
discipline of structure and rules. When there is a balance of decisions
made for the benefit of the ‘I’ with decisions made for the benefit of
the ‘WE,’ individuals and communities can prosper.

This sounds contradictory, but it’s not. Visit a Montessori classroom
to understand how a structured and disciplined classroom gives
children the greatest freedom to follow their own interests and
develop self-discipline, self-confidence, creativity and responsibility
to their community. This is true for a marketplace, society, and
economy as well.

**Capitalism does not have to be a wealth transfer machine. And, a
free market can be a fair and safe market, too.**
