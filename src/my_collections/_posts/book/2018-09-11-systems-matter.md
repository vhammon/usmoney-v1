Our money system is like a playing field; it determines what rules are
needed and how the game is played. For example, you cannot play foot-
ball on a tennis court. Or if you run at a nearby school, you will likely
run on the track that circles the center field. You could run back and
forth across the middle of the field, but imagine how difficult it would
be if a football game were in progress!

Game fields are a metaphor for how our mind and our society
works: just as we move according to the rules of the game on a playing
field, we think according to the paths set by our education, culture and
experience. Our lives work like this, too: we live in the grooves of our
thinking and culture. It takes a determined, conscious effort to step off
the track and out of these grooves to see them clearly.

## Two-way shaping

On a football field with a team of players who agree to follow the rules
of football, characteristics of the players will be reinforced over time.
The quarterback will be trim and fleet of foot. The linemen will be bulky.
The game requires certain behavior and behavior shapes the physiques
of the players.

The same applies to us: we may think we shape our homes and our
communities, but it is two-way shaping. We begin with our genetic heri-
tage and then the individuals we become – our attitude, values, skills,
even our tastes – are shaped by the families and communities in which
we live. The physical environment and the culture shape us. Since it is
possible to develop an understanding of how we are shaped, we have
the capacity to turn around and make choices to reshape our culture
and environment.

### An example

I was Head of a Montessori school for many years and had occasion
to discuss the nature of children with both traditional and Montessori
teachers. Traditional teachers often bemoaned what they believed to
be a fact: children are lazy and will do as little schoolwork as possible.
