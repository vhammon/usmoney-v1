Our money system is like a playing field; it determines what rules are
needed and how the game is played. For example, you cannot play football on a tennis court. Or if you run at a nearby school, you will likely
run on the track that circles the center field. You could run back and
forth across the middle of the field, but imagine how difficult it would
be if a football game were in progress!

Game fields are a metaphor for how our mind and our society
works: just as we move according to the rules of the game on a playing
field, we think according to the paths set by our education, culture and
experience. Our lives work like this, too: we live in the grooves of our
thinking and culture. It takes a determined, conscious effort to step off
the track and out of these grooves to see them clearly.

## Two-way shaping

On a football field with a team of players who agree to follow the rules
of football, characteristics of the players will be reinforced over time.
The quarterback will be trim and fleet of foot. The linemen will be bulky.
The game requires certain behavior and behavior shapes the physiques
of the players.

The same applies to us: we may think we shape our homes and our
communities, but it is two-way shaping. We begin with our genetic heritage and then the individuals we become – our attitude, values, skills,
even our tastes – are shaped by the families and communities in which
we live. The physical environment and the culture shape us. Since it is
possible to develop an understanding of how we are shaped, we have
the capacity to turn around and make choices to reshape our culture
and environment.

### An example

I was Head of a Montessori school for many years and had occasion
to discuss the nature of children with both traditional and Montessori
teachers. Traditional teachers often bemoaned what they believed to
be a fact: children are lazy and will do as little schoolwork as possible. These teachers believed rewards and punishment are
necessary classroom tools. Montessori teachers know that in the right
environment kids are naturally eager learners. Children learn because
they love to learn when they are given the freedom to do so in a well-
equipped classroom with skilled guides. There is then no need for
them to expect a reward for every correct action and punishment for
transgressions. Children develop different attitudes and characteristics
in different environments and different types of classrooms.

In the same way, people who grow up in one money system will
have different attitudes and characteristics from those who grow up
in another. Within one system some people may be dishonest, get
away with anything they can, and value money more than the health
of their communities. Within another system, people may act quite
differently. Systems can bring out the best or worst in our nature.

Because it is so important we understand how much our money
system matters, here is another example of how the system we choose
determines outcomes and reflects specific values.

Only a generation or two back, it was standard practice for teachers
to grade on the curve. Grading on the curve compared everyone’s
performance with the rest of their class; it did not determine whether
everyone had mastered a subject. When grading on the curve, even
if everyone did well, only a small number could get ‘A’s and some
had to flunk. Grades have lifetime impacts, so choosing to grade on
the curve meant some kids were labeled the best and some the worst.
Grading on the curve said we valued establishing an elite and culling
flunkies; we did not care so much about competency.

We recognized this system did not match our values, and we changed
it. Most teachers today grade on competency because we are clear
we value competency over establishing a hierarchy of greater and
lesser people. This conscious change matches our grading system to
our values. We value giving everyone an equal shot at mastering an
education and we made that value match our practices.
Our money system has lifetime impacts: Who has the best chance
of succeeding with new enterprise? Is the playing field level? Do we
fund prevention or crisis management? How equitably is wealth
distributed in our society?

What drives our economy? Health? Long-term sustainability? Short-
term profits? Family values? Efficiency? Stability? Hard work?
Privilege? Who has the power to make choices for us all?

When we understand our money system is not working as we would
like, we can choose a different system that more closely matches
our values.

**We can change our system.**
