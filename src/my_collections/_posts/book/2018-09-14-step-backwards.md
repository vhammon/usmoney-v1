While we think about what kind of money system would serve
us best, let’s consider some short-term measures that we could
take – step backwards, apply bandages to multiple wounds, or take
bridge steps.

## Backwards

We could free banking from the rules, standards and protections that
constitute banking law. This would be a step backwards. But, it’s a
popular idea. Some Libertarians advocate a return to a Wild West of
banking. Twentieth Century economist F.A. Hayek’s first quote is a
concise statement of an idea that has governed our economics, our
government and our money system for the past 100 years: decisions
made in the private marketplace, based on self-interest, are the best
decisions. Again, there’s no evidence for this axiom. The opposite
seems to be true as explained in Chapter 6. Hayek’s quote number
two shows that he misunderstood who creates money, or is referring
to a time so far in the distant past as to be irrelevant.

But, if you believe sheer self-interest leads to best outcomes, it makes
sense for money to be created, not by the will of the people through
government, but by the will of selfish players in the marketplace. And,
a money creation system free of the political will of the people has
been successfully sold as an asset to our nation. Economists, people
at the Fed and in government speak proudly of the fact that our
Federal Reserve money creation system, and it’s private member-owner banks operates _independently_ – without interference from our
duly and democratically elected government. If you’re a believer, this
is desirable.

Some believers in free market doctrine go a step further and want
money creation to be like any other business, with only very basic – if
any – rules and regulations. Their free banks would face no additional
regulation and oversight particular to banks or to money creation.
In free banking there is no central bank providing services or acting
as a lender (and money creator) of last resort, unless it is created by
private banking monopolies. There is no government insurance of
bank deposits or of the bankers’ proprietary IOUs. The market decides
which banks survive and prosper, through the same trial and error
every business faces.

Free banking would allow anyone to become a bank and provide
both banking and money creation services in a free and unregulated
marketplace. Some banks might operate as 100% gold commodity
money banks. Others might use a fractional reserve money creation
system, with a gold reserve or simply based on the strength of their
wealth and prestige. Others might create a virtual currency (like
Bitcoin). Private businesses would service the need to exchange one
of these many currencies for another. In an unregulated market, none
of them would need to tell you how they operate. User beware – and
keep in mind the popular idea it’s OK to sacrifice a few customers to
make bigger profits. If it’s OK to kill, it’s surely OK to rob you blind.

Free banking advocates usually ground their views in _faux-free_ market
theory that says when businesses are free to do business in any way
they see fit, they will make rational decisions in their business’s
best interest. When every business is operating in its best interest
there will be a balancing tension that benefits everyone. As rational,
decision-making consumers make their buying and selling decisions,
they will pick the banking businesses that do right by their customers and the nation. Only the righteous businesses will survive. The
collapse of poorly run banking businesses will harm many people, but
that is the law of the free-and-not-responsible-enterprise jungle. In
theory, smart people don’t pick loser banks. If someone picks a loser
bank and loses their money, that’s just the way of the world.

There’s no evidence pure _free_ market banking and money creation
ever worked. Unregulated private enterprise chooses the path to
selfish profits nearly every time. It often chooses making a fast buck
over the safety of the customers, communities involved, and even its
own long-term interests. But, the value of selfishness is an easy sell.
Our inner child welcomes a rationalization for, _“I am the center of the
universe, and it is all about me and what I want.”_

Historical evidence shows an effective government is necessary
to protect individuals and the community from selfish predators.
Applying our intelligence, understanding other points of view,
looking out for the interests of as many people as possible, and
protecting the commons, is the best recipe for prosperity. So free
banking is a poor choice.
