This is a book about our money system, why we need to change it, and a better alternative. It has been an intriguing challenge to understand money and then figure out a way to make it easy for others to understand. The information in this book is arranged from general to specific, with each chapter building on the information presented in previous chapters. Some people like to learn specific to general.

**Chapter 1** offers a quick introduction and acknowledgment that we are a nation in financial distress with a dysfunctional democracy.
