The difference between linear and exponential growth must be
absolutely clear to understand our money system and its impact
on our lives. Any growth by a percentage is exponential. When
we talk about a 3 percent annual growth rate for our economy,
we are talking about exponential growth. When we talk about a
steady rate of increase in our money supply, we are talking about
exponential growth.

## LINEAR

Linear growth happens when you add. If you put $100 in a savings
account this year and add $100 every year, at the end of 50 years, you
would have $5,000 in your savings account. If you saved for 100 years,
you would have $10,000. This is linear growth. You use addition, and,
in this case, add a fixed amount.

## EXPONENTIAL

Exponential growth happens when you multiply. If you put $100 in
a savings account today and grow your savings at a rate of 10 percent
each year, at the end of 50 years, you will have $11,739. If you saved at
this rate for 100 years, you would have $1,378,061. This is exponential
growth. You use multiplication, and, in this case, multiply by the
percentage to get the amount of increase.

(I have four kids, and I always felt the first three added a linear
increase in the amount of activity. The fourth child seemed an
exponential increase!)

There is a wonderful Indian folktale, _One Grain of Rice,_ about a young
girl who earns a reward from a stingy Rajah. She asks for a reward of one grain of rice on the first day, and double the amount of rice from
the previous day for 30 days total. The Rajah says yes, thinking she’s
not asking for much. After all, it will only be two grains of rice, then
four grains, then eight...what a silly girl! By the 30th day of doubling,
it takes 536,870,912 grains of rice to make the day’s payment. Over
the 30 days, the girl has received more than a billion grains of rice –
all of the Rajah’s stores!
Humans are often focused on the present, and exponential growth
can lull us to sleep with its slow growth beginning. This is such an
important concept, here is another look at exponential growth in a
closed system:

Imagine a lake, larger than the eye can see. On one side of the lake a
traveler drops a tiny algae cell into the lake. When these algae cover a
surface of water, they block the sun and kill the fish beneath. But this
is a very tiny spore in a very big lake.

The algae reproduce rapidly, doubling in size every day – a 100%
growth rate. If you live on this side of the lake, you might see a tiny
spot of algae and then a growing expanse. If you live on the other
side of the lake, you won’t see any threat at all.

The algae continue to double. Some of the people on the algae side of
the lake get more and more agitated as they see the growing spread of
algae, which is destroying the fish habitat in the water it covers. A few,
who know their math, are nearly hysterical and waving _Save the Fish_
signs. The people on the other side of the lake are wondering what all
the fuss is about.

Many on both sides of the lake note that it is a big lake and the algae
are only taking up a fraction of the surface.

One day, the algae cover half of the lake surface. People look out
and say, _“Hmm, looks like we’ve got a growing problem. We will have
to act soon. Maybe we should set up a commission to study it.”_ Others
point out the algae only cover half the lake, and it would cost too
much money to do anything about it, and surely some enterprising entrepreneur will step in and fix it. The next day, the lake is covered
and all the fish die.

NO living system on planet earth can sustain exponential growth.
This is an immutable fact. All living systems have checks that
maintain balance. The only living things that grow exponentially and
unchecked (for a time), such as bacteria and cancer cells, kill their
hosts and then die. The question for us: will we recognize the threat
our money system presents and take action in time?

## Bending the curve

In real life, living systems do not grow or change with mathematical
precision. There are too many variables and too many unexpected
impacts. Perhaps when the traveler dropped the single spore into the
water, he told someone these algae are edible and rich in nutrients;
they can be harvested and a beneficial crop for your community – a
great business opportunity!

However, they find it is not worth harvesting until it has grown to a
substantial size, and there is only a modest demand for the algae, so
the harvesting reduces the growth rate from 100% – doubling every
day – to a growth rate of about 75 percent. We have added an interest
group that wants to keep the algae growing because it creates jobs
and makes them a profit.

Shaving off a bit of the growth rate stretches out the exponential
curve but does not change the fact that if the algae continue to grow
by a steady percentage each year, they will cover the lake – a little
later, rather than sooner, but inevitably. That’s the math. Hanging
onto the jobs now can kill all the food and jobs later.

Our brains are shaped to see the immediate and not the underlying
inevitability. So, you can easily imagine lots of arguments about what
caused the _“sudden catastrophic increase”_ in the algae growth.

## Deceptively slow

Hold the image of an exponential curve; the slow, almost flat
beginning, the gentle swing upward, then the nearly vertical line
off the chart. At first exponential growth appears deceptively slow,
manageable and even something to celebrate... until it’s not.
