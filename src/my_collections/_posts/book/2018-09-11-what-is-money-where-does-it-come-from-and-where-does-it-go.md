—Attributed to Henry Ford, Sr. (1863–1947)
by Representative Charles G. Binderup of
Nebraska, Congressional Record, 1937<sup>6</sup>

We work hard for money. We save it. We spend it. How come
sometimes there is too much money in the economy, and some
people are giddy with buying and selling? Prices on real estate and
other assets soar upward. Where does all that money come from?

How come the euphoria is nearly always followed by a period when
there is not enough money to go around? Businesses close, people are
out of work, some people sell off assets at fire sale prices to survive.

The number of people willing to work and spend has not changed, so
what happens to the money? Where does it go?

The fabric of our communities is a warp of personal relationships and
a weft of exchanging our goods and services. Money is a shuttle for
building the weft. It is an incredibly useful utility that we generally
take for granted. We use money like we breathe – unconsciously. We
make something or provide a service and someone pays us money
for our efforts. We turn around and use this money to buy a product
or service from someone else. When we think about where money
comes from, most people see the image of the government printing
presses churning out the bills. This hides the way money really works.

So, what is it really? How many of us understand how money
establishes the foundation of our economy and pushes us toward
certain outcomes? Even when reading economic textbooks,
an understanding of money is mostly elusive. Changing the
consequences of our current money system depends on our
understanding it and discovering our options. Let’s spend some
time making sure that all of us understand our money system and
our options.
