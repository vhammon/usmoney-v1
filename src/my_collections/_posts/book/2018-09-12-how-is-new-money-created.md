_The Federal Reserve Act of 1913_ made law a fractional reserve money
creation system: private banks create new US money when they
exchange their own IOU-future-value notes, called _Federal Reserve
Notes,_ for an IOU from either the public or the government.

When the Fed system was first established it was genuinely a reserve
system, with gold (and a little silver) as the reserve. The individual
banks with the power to create new money had to maintain a reserve
of gold bullion equal to 5–18 percent.<sup>27</sup> For every one dollar worth of
gold they kept on hand, they could issue their own IOUs promising
to produce six to twenty dollars’ worth of gold on demand. However,
it took only 16 years to go through irrationally exuberant money
creation to the crash of 1929 and a decade of tight-money depression.
This tells us the gold reserve requirements were not an effective
constraint on the banks.

The _central_ Fed maintained a ratio of Gold Certificate reserves to
Federal Reserve Notes and deposit liabilities that slowly dwindled
from 88 percent in 1914 to 27 percent in 1967. Recording this measure
was discontinued at that time, and three years later we went off the
gold standard, which had required keeping a percentage of gold on
reserve as collateral for bank promises. This shifted the burden of
guarantee completely from the private banks to the common wealth
of the nation. An over-controlling government did not make this
move; it was made under pressure from bankers.

Today, the law has been amended so the system functions more like
a no-reserve, no-limits system – particularly for the large banks that
control most banking business and money creation. Community
banks still have to meet some prudent reserve requirements, making
it harder for them to compete and stay in business and pushing us
toward an increasingly monopolistic banking sector.

How coins and cash are manufactured and then turned into money
by entering them into the economy at their face value is covered
in the next section. Here’s how the rest, roughly 97 percent of our
money is created under the Federal Reserve Act.

## How it works

When you go to the bank for a loan, you pledge the income from
your work in the future. You may guarantee you will pay by pledging
wealth you have now as collateral (e.g., the equity in your home,
your car, or stock or bullion certificates). The bank takes your IOU,
and loans you money. It does not have the money it loans to you;
it creates it for you. Some economists call this _book money_ or _sight
money_ – now it’s on the books; now you see it.

The amount of your loan is its face value. The bank enters the face
value of your IOU as an asset on its balance sheet. Then with a few
keystrokes, it enters a matching amount into your account. The bank
is pledging to produce that amount at any time for you. You give
the bank your IOU and the bank gives you its IOUs (Federal Reserve
Notes). In the bank’s accounts, there is an IOU from you entered as
an asset of the bank. And there is the bank’s IOU of the cash or digital
equivalent it must produce on demand entered as a liability. On the
bank’s balance sheet it nets out: You Owe Me = IOU.

Assume that you took no other action, and your loan money is just
sitting in your deposit account. If you authorized the bank to take
the money and pay back the loan, the bank would cancel your IOU
and cancel its own IOU to you. Ignoring the interest you owe, the
accounts would be back to net zero. The money the bank created
for you would vanish and the money supply would shrink by that
amount.

But for an individual, taking out a loan and paying it back takes
place over time. If we just look at one person’s borrowing and then
spending, we lose sight of the overall creation and extinction of the
money supply. An individual’s borrowed money is likely out in the
economy circulating, returning to the bank as people transfer money
or pay back their own loans.

In terms of money creation and destruction by the bank, the system
works in aggregate. Banks have IOUs from many, many people on
the asset side of their ledgers. They have deposits constantly moving
in and out of accounts and between other banks. These deposits are
liabilities; the bank has to produce this money on demand. Banks
are constantly juggling all these IOUs and you-owe-me’s so that
they are able to meet their obligations and make as much money as
possible. If everyone paid back their loans at once, there would be no
money in the system, and there would be no money to pay interest.
But, it doesn’t happen at one time. All the money circulates. And in
our system, the banks continuously grow the money supply so that
they can extract interest on the money they’ve created. If they did
not increase the supply of money, the interest would have to come
from the pool of other people’s borrowing that makes up the general
money supply, diminishing the amount of money available for
general transactions.

## Are there limits on money creation?

### In practice: no reserve requirements

Fractional reserve bankers have been gaming this system for hundreds
of years. They are very good at it. Under _The Federal Reserve Act,_
bankers continue at this game; they’ve just gotten better at hiding
their games in nests of companies, derivatives and fancy financial
instruments.

The Fed itself says reserve requirements today affect less than
10 percent of the money supply and, _“the tight link suggested by the
multiplier between reserves and money and bank lending does not exist.”_
<sup>28</sup> Over several hundred years, bank money creators have successfully
convinced lawmakers reserves are excess money that is not being fully
utilized in the economy. They call the reserves a waste and inefficiency
needing remedy.

Effective January 2018, the law requires no reserve on deposits (bank
promises) up to $16 million, 3 percent from $16 million to $122.3
million, and 10 percent for more than $122.3 million.<sup>29</sup> But, banks
can count the vault deposits they would need anyway to manage their
ATM and cash withdrawals, as reserve – because multi-tasking money
is efficient. They have used the central banking system, and jiggered
the law so they can reduce their reserves even further.

Here’s an example of how banks get around reserve requirements
today: under current US law there are different reserve requirements
for different kinds of accounts. Ordinary deposit accounts have the
highest reserve requirements. Money market accounts do not require
any reserves, as they are considered investment accounts even when
they are also used as checking accounts.

Bankers have figured out that if a second or two before it is time to
do their daily accounting of how much reserve they need to have on
hand, they move the balances in their deposit accounts (10 percent
reserve) into a money market account (zero percent reserve), then
they don’t need to have reserves for that money. After the calculation
of reserves and reporting, another accounting entry moves the funds
back into the deposit accounts. This is called a _daily sweep,_ and is just
one example of the legal capers that virtually eliminate the need for
reserves and make a mockery of a reserve requirement.<sup>30</sup>

### In practice: inadequate capital requirements

Capital or equity requirements are still in place. By 2019, bankers
must total up their assets, and meet a ratio of $8 in equity for every
$100 in new money they have created against IOUs. But, bankers
have written our laws so they can weight assets based on their own
judgment of risk, or on the judgment of a ratings agency whose
services they buy – a conflict of interest that played a role in the 2007
market collapse.

#### OFF BALANCE SHEET

US banks have been slowly stepping up to meet these requirements
using US accounting standards. However, using European accounting
standards, which do not allow as much off-balance sheet activity,
our banks are still closer to 4 percent equity. For example, Forbes
reported that by US accounting standards, JPMorgan Chase, the largest commercial bank in the US (2012), had $103 billion in
equity for $2,292 billion in assets – a 4.5 percent ratio of capital to
assets. However, the $2,292 billion was only what US law requires
be reported. JPMorgan had another $1,660 billion in assets that they
were keeping off their books.<sup>31</sup>

If JPMorgan had been required to use recommended international
standards, they would have needed to report an additional $1,660
billion in assets. On their books, this $1,660 billion would cut their
capital ratio to 2.6 percent – a stunning ratio of reported assets to
hidden assets: 2,292 to 1,660. Forty-two percent of their total assets
were hidden off their books!

This capital ratio means that if in 2012 JPMorgan’s juggling of
incoming and outgoing IOU-future-value promises had been deficient
by more than 2.6 percent, the bank would have been insolvent.
Hardly prudent in a money system that gives the power to create a
nation’s money to these bankers, tying the well-being of the national
economy to their choices. That 2.6 percent is pretty close to nothing
by any reasonable standard, and is considered representative of most
of the big global banks.

#### DEFINING ASSETS

Again as noted in [Chapter 4.35,](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-4/section-35) in addition to moving assets off
balance sheet, banks have a great deal of freedom to define what
constitutes an asset to meet this requirement. For example, banks
can include goodwill as an asset. JPMorgan Chase in 2014 meets its
8 percent requirement by counting $48 billion in goodwill as part of
its $232 billion in common shareholder equity. Goodwill is 21 percent
of their equity!<sup>32</sup> If they are insolvent and defaulting on their
promises, what good will goodwill do? It will evaporate.

Goodwill should not be a bankable asset on the balance sheet of a
bank. Imagine going to your banker for a loan and listing goodwill
valued at one fifth of your total net assets. You could smile all you
want and bring in your membership to Rotary and the PTA, and
the bank would dismiss this line item as nonsense. It would be no guarantee you could meet your loan obligations. Yet, bankers have
successfully written our laws to allow them to include this as a line
item on their own books.

However assets are counted, 2–8 percent skin in the game isn’t much
in a system designed to be volatile with routine asset bubbles and
busts swinging well beyond 8 percent.

### Real limits?

In practice, there are hardly any limits on how much new money
bankers create with their lending. They are only limited by their
mood. When they are confident, they make more loans; when they
are not confident, they stop making loans. This means the supply of
money in our economy is the result of the mood swings of bankers.
Most decision-makers in the financial sector are men. When they
win, their testosterone goes up and they are more inclined to take
more and bigger risks. When they lose, their testosterone goes down
and they become risk averse. Our economy is jerked around by these
hormonal swings [(Chapter 6.63).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-6/section-63)

**The privilege and power of money creation gives the banks and
the people in positions of power within them an unprecedented
edge in the marketplace.**
