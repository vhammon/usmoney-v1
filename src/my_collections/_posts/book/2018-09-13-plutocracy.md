The US is not a democratic republic. It cannot be. Big Money
rules. We are now an oligarchic plutocracy or plutocratic oligarchy,
whichever you prefer to call it (rule of a wealthy few). We gave the
ruling power to a cabal of private bankers and their wealthy friends.

The very rich are steadily extending their ownership and control
over the nation, apparently aiming to own it all. And, if you graph
the wealth shifting to a tinier and tinier percentage of Americans,
it is clear that they are well on their way! Special privileges speed
the journey.

## Privileges for the wealthy

The word _privilege_ comes from a Latin word meaning a law for just
one person – a private law. And, that is what the very rich money
creators have in our system: they have privileges available to no
one else.

### General Privilege

There are general privileges that come with being rich that exist in any
money system. These privileges are amplified in our system.

It is easier for the rich to get richer. It is not only a matter of getting
the best tables in a restaurant for dinner. The wealthy are paid more
than someone who comes from a poor background for doing the
same work. Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies with Harvard
University and the University of Cambridge found that even with
the same education from a prestige university the 10 percent highest-
earning male graduates from richer backgrounds earned about
20 percent more than the 10 percent highest earners from relatively
poorer backgrounds.^188

There is a marked link between parental income and the earning potential of their children. And with control of tax laws very
wealthy people today can hold on to most of their wealth for their
descendants, passing their privilege on to the next generation and
establishing an aristocracy of inherited wealth.

Our money system gives advantages to this tiny elite, ensuring they
never have to play on an equal playing field. While some people work
hard or innovate and build companies that make them extraordinarily
wealthy, once they reach a certain level of wealth, they have the
opportunity to join the tiny elite who can create new money for their
own financial gaming and keep it for generations.

### Privilege of determining the direction of our economy and culture

Money-creators decide where the money they create goes first. And,
once they’re extraordinarily wealthy, they have power to determine
where our public spending goes too, by controlling the media, the
propaganda, and the lawmakers with their contributions. Money-
creators determine whether we invest in a global war machine;
or sustainable energy; or use our wealth to assure everyone has
food, shelter, healthcare and education; or whether we have a few
with closets bigger than houses and thousands of thousand-dollar
shoes. They decide the nature and direction of the economy, which
determines what opportunities are available to you and how easy or
hard it will be to achieve your goals. That is power.

In 2017 JPMorgan held over $2.5 trillion in assets. In a very broad
systemic sense this means that it created or controls over 18 percent of
the total 2017 money supply.^189 One bank. A twelve-member board
of directors set policy that determined the choices made when this
money was created. TWELVE people decided what the priorities were
for the creation of roughly one in five dollars. They decided whether
the money would be created for gaming on Wall Street, or to build
another mall, or repair highways or buy back stock to pump up CEO
salaries, or build schools or merge and acquire another company,
or invest in new energy technologies, set aside green space, or pay
teachers. That is power. And, keep in mind the FDIC can only cover
about one percent of total consumer deposits in a systemic collapse, so all by itself, JPMorgan could take down our entire economy with a
few bad decisions.

These choices matter because they set the quality of our lives.
Decisions are made with no input from our democratic government.
This is the privilege of a plutocracy, and they maintain their power
and wealth by avoiding risks and giving preference to investments
with short-term personal benefits and proven technologies.

#### SHORT-TERM BENEFITS PREVAIL

A small angel investor class shoots for the Big Win in new technology.
But neither this group, nor the bank money lender-creators make
many investments in technologies that may take decades to produce
income or that may produce dispersed value for the nation as a whole,
but no direct profits for private individuals. Without investment in
long-term potential, we shortchange the future.

The very rich have reduced their taxes such that we have fewer tax
dollars for long-term government research and development. Our
investment in R&D has dropped from 1.2 percent of GDP in 1980
to 0.7 percent in 2018. As a percent of the federal budget, the drop is
from 10 percent down to 3 percent.^190 This is a mistake.

For example, while reaching for the stars, many space program
inventions found their way into our lives – memory foam, radiant
heat shield insulation, water filters, invisible braces, to name only a
few of thousands of innovations. Today the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) barely scratches along. At the
height of the space program in 1966, NASA’s budget was 4.4 percent
of government spending. Today it is about 0.5 percent.^191 This is
shortsighted.

#### PROVEN TECHNOLOGIES PREVAIL

Banks generally choose to create new money by lending to existing,
proven profit-making industries. This is one reason why, despite
innovations, the dinosaur fuel industry still gets the biggest support
from the financial sector and the political sector.

In the mid 1990s I was at a social event in Marin, California. I was
fortunate to enjoy a conversation with Mark Reisner, American
environmentalist and author of _Cadillac Desert: The American West
and its Disappearing Water_ – originally published in 1986, revised and
reprinted in hopes someone would finally listen in 1993.^192 He talked
passionately about the rice field burning in California. This burning
polluted the air and wasted a resource. In Asia, for centuries they
had been cutting the leftover straw and using it for many different
applications, including building materials. There were profitable
models for this kind of factory. Reisner said he had been working
for decades to get banks or venture capital to lend or invest in this
environmentally friendly approach. No one was interested; it was
new and unproven in the US.

The good news is that the Central Valley rice industry and the
California legislature finally listened and worked together to reduce
the burning from about 95 percent of the crops in 1980 to less
than 10 percent in 2010. Thirty years of asthma were a preventable
hardship, but good sense finally prevailed. And, note: it took
government intervention and encouragement. Private business was
not willing to do it on their own.^193

The first solar collector was created in **1767.** In 1839 a French scientist
identified the first photovoltaic effect. In 1873 the photoconductivity
of selenium and it’s emission of solar energy was discovered.^194 It
took until the late 1940s – nearly 200 years later – for solar power to
become commercially available. By the 1950s it was used to power
our space station. Early public investment in renewable technologies
could have dramatically changed our nation’s energy usage, reducing
the reliance on military might to maintain our access to oil.

In 1979 to support such an effort President Jimmy Carter put solar
panels on the White House to demonstrate their viability. In 1981,
one of President Reagan’s first actions was to remove the solar panels - a clear message of his values and his support for the dinosaur fuels
    making money for the owners of great wealth. Think how many
    bombs we’ve dropped, and how many of our service men and women
have died, or been permanently harmed over the past 30 years to
protect our fossil fuel dependence – unnecessarily!
If asked, would citizens have invested in innovative technology that
could save everyone in the nation a bundle and save unnecessary war
deaths? Probably. However, the decision was made by Big Money to
benefit themselves in the short term. There are countless examples
of innovative technologies that took overly long to develop because
they required a longer investment timeline than capital owners and
money creators were willing to risk: high speed rail transit; water
conservation technologies; wind, wave, and geothermal energy.

We have given this privilege of choosing the direction of our economy
to people who look out for their own short-term bottom line,
whether or not it benefits the nation – and we suffer accordingly. The
nations that lead the world in sustainable energy had robust public
funding for their development – Sweden, Costa Rica, Nicaragua,
Scotland, and Germany. The US is #10 on the list.^195

#### PRIVILEGE OF HIGH LEVERAGE

Banks, bankers and their friends do not need to own money to
use money to make money. For example, in 2017, our largest bank
JPMorgan Chase owned $9.97 for every $100 they had earning
income by US accounting standards. By European accounting
standards, they only owned about $6. This ratio of owned to invested
is called leverage.^196 Note that regulations matter. This 2017 leverage
is up from the 2–4 percent leverage of 2007.

The average person or business cannot be leveraged so highly. If you
have $6,000 in net worth, the bank is not going to lend you $100,000
to use for speculating in the market place. You would have to be good
friends with an unprincipled banker.

Here’s how this privilege extracts wealth from the marketplace: If
you invest $100,000 you own for a 10 percent return, you will earn
$10,000. Someone with access to a big line of credit can put only
$1,000 of their own money on the line for this same investment. They
can borrow $99,000 and make the same bet. They earn the same $10,000, minus interest on the borrowed money. A high-speed trader
holding the investment for microseconds, will pay next to nothing
in interest. They will earn the same $10,000 on a $1,000 investment.
This is one of the ways hedge funds and Wall Street gamers make
annual returns of 20–30 percent. It is not because they have invested
capital in a business that tripled in size; they earn these returns
gaming the system because they have access to credit that ordinary
people in ordinary business do not have.

### Privilege of low taxes

Our tax laws favor business and a wealthy few. This was true before
Republicans passed a new tax law in December 2017 that for 10 years
gives the top 0.4 percent of all filers 16.5 percent of the total benefits.
From 2028 and thereafter, the bill gives 82 percent of the total
benefits to the top 0.6 percent of all filers. A little carrot and then
a big stick for the general population. A big carrot and then more
carats for the wealthiest Americans.^197

#### INDIVIDUAL TAXES

The very wealthy make most of their money in the form of capital
gains, or what they sometimes call _carried interest;_ wages are a
relatively small part of their income. The reverse is true for 90 percent
of us. The tax rate is set to advantage the very wealthy: taxes on
capital gains are considerably lower than they are on wage income.
Multi-billionaire Warren Buffet famously noted he pays a lower tax
rate than his secretary.

Adding to favorable tax policy, wealthy individuals avoid as many
taxes as possible. In the 1920s, those with the highest incomes and
extreme wealth reduced their tax rates down into the 20th percentiles.
After the mess they made of the economy, the 1929 crash and the
Great Depression, the rate slowly rose to a high of 94 percent in 1945 - in part due to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s belief that the very
    wealthy should pay their full share to support the war effort.

This highest rate remained at about 90 percent through the 1950s
and 1960s. We invested in a strong infrastructure and had a booming economy.^198 This high rate balanced some of the extraordinary
privileges of the money power and kept money recirculating on Main
Street. This highest rate was never applied to all the money a very
rich person made; the rate climbed the more they earned, so for the
first brackets of income, they were paying rates the same as someone
whose income topped out at those lower brackets.
In 2018, after decades of the wealthy promoting limited government,
trickle-down economics, and the idea that taxes are a form of theft,
individual tax rates for the very rich have dropped to a maximum
rate of 37 percent – and this is only on their income over $500,000
(2018). Most of the super-rich use tax avoidance schemes that either
eliminate taxes, or reduce their rate to single digits. The average
effective tax rate of the top one percent of tax filers was 27 percent
in 2016.^199

And, when these few super-rich people die they can now preserve
most of their estates for their children. Eliminating estate taxes
benefits less than 0.2 percent of Americans (remember the top
0.1 percent owns 22 percent of all wealth in America).^200 Estate taxes
hit the top tiniest percent of people almost entirely. But, the super-
rich have successful sold the idea that taxing big estates is a _death
tax_ and _double taxation._ One study found the financial support for
eliminating inheritance taxes came from 18 super-rich families. These
people provide the anti-government activists with most of the money
for this anti-tax effort. So, 18 families are driving a grassroots campaign
to cut their focus-group tested _death taxes_ – leaving most Americans
to fill the gap in government revenues.^201 If you’re on this bandwagon,
the super-rich are conducting the band.

#### CORPORATE TAXES

We have a curious mindset about taxes. A wage earner can take a few
specific deductions from gross pay to arrive at taxable income. One
of these, the mortgage deduction is designed to get more people
borrowing to buy houses. But, the gross income of an individual
without deductions can equal net taxable income. People don’t get to
deduct the expenses of living.

In contrast, a business entity – a money-making-for-owner-entity, can
subtract all its expenses before arriving at a net taxable income. This
policy says we value the money-making of businesses over the wage-
earning of individuals. We value the supply side over the demand side,
businesses over consumers, owners over wage earners. Those values
are not in line with a Constitution that was written to promote the
General Welfare and Domestic Tranquility.

If corporations are people when it comes to electioneering and free
speech, why not consider them people when it comes to taxes?
Some may argue businesses pass their tax on to consumers. But this
argument applies to labor, too. Labor must demand enough in wages
to live and pay taxes, and the expense of labor is added to the cost to
consumers.

In addition to their policy advantage, corporations have successfully
lobbied to shrink their taxes. In the 1950s, a decade considered a
prosperous economy, corporations as a group paid an average of more
than 49 percent of their profits in federal corporate income taxes.
Decade by decade this average shrunk: 1960s – 38 percent; 1970s – 33;
1990s – 25 percent. By 2017, they paid 18 percent, though by statute
the tax rate never dropped below 35 percent for all those years.^202 203

In 2012, America’s 10 most profitable corporations paid an average
income tax rate of only 9 percent – including JPMorgan Chase
our biggest bank and money creator, and Wells Fargo Bank. Oil
company ExxonMobil paid a tax rate of 2 percent, and Chevron paid
4 percent.^204

The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analyzed 258 of the
Fortune 500 companies that earned $3.8 trillion in profits over the
eight years from 2008 to 2015. They found:

* 8 paid ZERO in taxes over the full eight-year period.
* 100 paid zero – or less – in at least one profitable year during the
      eight-year period, and 58 of those companies had multiple zero-
  tax years.
* 24 companies zeroed out their taxes in at least four of the eight years.
* 48 companies paid a rate between 0 and 10 percent over
    eight years.^205

Corporations have shrunk their overall share of taxes, too. Corporate
income tax as a share of GDP dropped from a high of 6 percent in
1952 to 1.6 percent in 2017.^206 207

Corporate income tax as a share of the federal government’s operating
fund dropped from 43 percent in 1952 to 14 percent in 2017.^208 In part
this is because there has been an increase in wealthy individuals filing
as S-corporations, but overall, the share of corporate business taxes
has dropped.

In 2017, individual income tax payments were five times the
contributions of corporations. Individuals paid $1,526 billion in
income taxes, and ALL the corporations in our great nation only paid
$299 billion in corporate income taxes on $2,248 billion in all-time
high corporate profits.^209

The Institute for Policy Studies found, _“Of America’s 100 highest-paid
CEOs, 29 received more in pay last year than their company paid in
federal income taxes – up from 25 out of the top 100 in our 2010 and 2011
surveys.”_ 210 We’ve either got a bunch of loser businesses or unethical,
immoral weasels, unwilling to pay a fair share for the benefits they
reap living in this once great nation. This is privilege for the few. If
your politician is talking about business fleeing the US because of
high tax rates, they are creating a smoke screen for Big Money.

While corporate profits have been running at all-time highs for
several years, Republicans passed the 2017 tax law. It cut corporate
tax rates from a range of 15–25 percent for businesses with incomes
under $75,000, and a range of 34–39 percent for corporations with
incomes of $75,000 and above. The 2018 corporate tax rate is a flat
21 percent. This tax cut is expected to reduce government revenues by $1.5 trillion over the next ten years. This will require cuts to
government programs that today assure some circulation of money
in local communities. Support for the common wealth will shift
further toward individual taxpayers. By June 2018 Republicans were
presenting bills to make up this revenue loss by cutting Medicare,
Social Security and other safety net programs like food stamps for
poor children. Cuts to these programs will further increase income
extremes, transferring wealth from the 99 percent to the one percent.

### Privilege of operating broke

When an ordinary business makes too many mistakes and loses
too much money it goes out of business. When a big bank makes
too many mistakes and loses too much money, it will be saved
by its central bank – with a guarantee for the save from the US
Government. Banks justly argue that a Big Bank failure will take the
entire economy down, so a taxpayer guarantee is in the nation’s best
interest.

Nearly all the big US banks were insolvent in 2007.^211 Their assets
had dropped more than 4 percent in value; it would have taken
more than they had in reserve and in equity to cover their promises
coming due. The central Fed bailed them out, with a US government
guarantee. These bailouts were often used by the banks to pay wealthy
creditors who had made poor investments themselves.

With this government-common wealth guarantee, the Big Banks
safely make more profitable higher risk bets, though they are putting
the nation at risk of bigger busts. The profits are privatized and the
risk shifts to the public. In 2008, access to the central bank’s lender-
of-last-resort-save-mechanism was extended to our biggest privately
owned corporations. But it is a privilege accorded to no one else.

## Crime does pay

The root of the word privilege is private law. Bankers have their own
set of laws, that allow them to lie, cheat and steal, and in nearly every
case they will be ignored, protected or exonerated.

### Privilege of being above the law

Back in 2014 I wrote that despite evidence of fraud, criminal
negligence and other criminal activity, not one banker went to
jail after the 2007–2008 meltdown. This was true through 2016.^212
Double checking references in 2018, I find that, yes, 35 bankers
went to jail!^213 So some wheels of justice turned. However, it took
almost ten years. And remember that if we’d jailed a proportionate
number to Iceland’s arrests after their 2007 meltdown, we’d have
arrested 600,000 – probably a more accurate reflection of the number
of people who participated in the fraud that led to the economy’s
collapse. So, the point holds. Bankers are still mostly quite privileged.

Here’s a significant example that took place at the highest level of
our privatized global money creation system: Our big global banks
created global central banking institutions for the same reasons
national banks create a central bank ([Chapter 3.25](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-3/section-25) & [4.32](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-4/section-32)). The
British Bankers Association, which is a cartel of big international
banks, monitors the rates at which its members lend to each other.
This global interbank lending rate is called LIBOR (London Interbank
Offer Rate). This rate underpins over $350 trillion in bank lending/
money creation and derivatives worldwide.

An investigation begun in 2012 found a number of international
banks had been making false reports to rig this rate to the benefit
of traders back as far as 2003. For at least 10 years, traders at big
banks rigged a rate that impacted the buying and selling of over
$350,000,000,000,000 in loans _every year._ The rate was rigged to
benefit a few at the expense of the many on $3.5 QUADRILLION _in
loans over the 10 years._ For this crime, the banks and their traders
were given a slap on the wrist fine of $9 billion. This is a tiny, tiny,
piddling fine compared to the profits they made on their crime. A
few individuals were charged, and acquitted. No one was jailed. In
2012, they made a specific law stating this rigging is a crime, as if
existing laws about fraud did not cover it. This is crime that did pay
the privileged bankers and traders.^214 215

While the LIBOR scandal took place on a global scale with global impact, the pattern is common at our national level. As some have
noted, the Ponzi artist Bernie Madoff did go to jail – because he
robbed the very rich. The bankers robbed the rest of us, and got off
mostly scot-free.

## CEO – Kings

### Kings of the money-making temples

Not so long ago, we recognized it takes everyone in a business to
make it a success. And we believed that there should be a fair and
equitable ratio of executive pay to worker pay. In recognition of these
values, in 1965, CEO salaries were 26 times their average worker pay.
Through the 1970s, CEO pay was determined based on a comparison
with the pay of other employees in the company, described as _internal
equity._ As recently as 1980, CEOs made roughly 43 times their average
employee’s salary.

But, as we head up the steeper and steeper exponential curve of
our money supply growth, CEO pay rose along a similar curve. A
new industry of executive compensation consultants arose in the
1980s and convinced companies to switch to basing CEO salaries
on _external equity._ This meant that instead of being viewed as part
of a team creating a successful company, CEOs would be viewed as
a unique and special class of people competing with other CEOs. If
a company wanted a better-than-average CEO, it would have to
pay more than the median CEO pay. Since everyone can’t be above
average, this drove a steady, exponential increase in CEO pay.^216 In
2018, estimates of this ratio range from 300 to 500.

In 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that
U.S. companies that are already required to publish an annual report,
must publish, _“the ratio of the median of the annual total compensation
of all employees to the annual total compensation of the chief Executive
officer... effective on or after January 1, 2017.”_ 217

We are beginning to have solid data on the disparity between CEO
pay and workers, so the justifications for this disparity are coming out as well. In February 2017, Alex Edmans at the Harvard Business
Review explained that CEOs were like one-of-a-kind sports or
entertainment stars and their salary should not be compared to
ordinary people.^218 The problem with this argument is that there is
no evidence that CEOs deserve this prima donna royal status.

Modern Index Strategy Indexes (MSCI) sampled 429 large-cap
US companies between 2006 and 2015, and found that _“average
shareholder returns were higher when a company’s CEO was in the
bottom 20% (of total compensation) than it was for companies whose
executives were in the top 20% of earners.”_ 219 Could it be that people
work harder and produce more in companies that treat them as
respected contributors? Companies that have a king and serf model
do not fare as well.

Our actions and policies say we value those who sit atop the
ranks of the money-makers more than we value anyone else to an
extraordinary and astounding degree. We have allowed the wealthiest
people to rule our country and our lives. I don’t believe this matches
are true values and our commitment to equal justice, broad-based
national prosperity, and domestic tranquility?
