## Clear thinking

We have discussed the importance of being clear when we talk about
types of government, money systems or economic systems. However,
because authenticity and trustworthiness require some form of power
and authority, we need to touch on the realm of governance. Just
keep in mind we’re talking about governance per se, and governance
takes many different forms, which are not the subject here.

## Authority

Every money system that ever existed has been overseen by some
authority responsible for assuring the money system has integrity,
people keep their promises, and pledges and property receipts can
be redeemed. Authority may be unwritten cultural norms and
consequences, or written laws requiring people are good for their
promise, pledge or IOU. In small communities, people may know
everyone’s history and who is good for their word, and unwritten
norms will suffice. Larger communities that include strangers, must
depend on some established authority – government and laws.

The past 200 years have been deeply influenced by a powerful myth:
the authority called the _free marketplace._ In this imaginary place,
trades can be managed and predicted with mathematical certainty,
or at least a high degree of probability, because they are all rational.
It is a place where, when everyone is free to do as they want, the
marketplace will become an all-knowing, magical and invisible hand
that establishes the true value and measure of all and everyone – in
monetary terms, of course. Efficiency and the ability of money to
make money are the highest values in this mythical place, dubbed
_laissez-fairyland_ by LA Times journalist Joel Havemann back in 1991.^6

The myth of the magical marketplace birthed the field of economics
as a subject that could be studied scientifically. According to the misconception that everyone is rational, if one figures out the correct
mathematical formulas, collects the right data and plugs it into a
computer – Presto! we get an economic theory with which to manage
economies or make stock picks.
It is a false and dangerous premise. For example, in 2000 a
mathematician named David X. Li created a formula called the
Gaussian Copula Function. In February 2009, Wired magazine
described this formula as

_...an unambiguously positive breakthrough, a piece of financial technology that
allowed hugely complex risks to be modeled with more ease and accuracy than
ever before. With his brilliant spark of mathematical legerdemain, Li made it
possible for traders to sell vast quantities of new securities, expanding financial
markets to unimaginable levels.^7_

Risk was supposed to be readily managed and reduced almost entirely.
It wasn’t. And, this blind faith in mathematical predictability and
the free market put the entire global economy into a tail spin and
depression.

No valid study of economics can consist solely of mathematicians
playing with numbers and relying on the market’s invisible hand.
Humanity’s interrelationships are deep and seldom predictably
rational – even by chaos or evolutionary systems theory. Society,
government, cultural values, healthy, wealthy and wise individuals,
business, resource extraction, and waste are inseparably interrelated.

A money system is by definition a community-wide system – and
every community has some form of authority and governance. Free
market advocates want the invisible hand of this mythical, rational
marketplace to rule as the ultimate authority. They want political
government to leave them alone – free to do as the market will allow.
In essence, they are demanding those with the most money rule,
because that is the predictable outcome when money is given free rein - it reigns.

## Trustworthiness and wealth

Wealth and the power it bestows establish the trustworthiness of most
money by serving as a form of guarantee. This wealth can belong
to an elite few who one hopes will act ethically and morally – or
who are considered divinely sanctioned to act any way they want
and it will be considered the way of the world. Or this wealth can
be the common wealth that is shared by all, some legally owned by
individuals, some owned by the public.

The notion there should be no common wealth, individuals should
own everything and they should be free to do as they want with what
they own, is part of the myth of the magical free marketplace. The
idea is that all these private owners will act rationally to protect their
investment and everything will work out for the best. This ignores
that we live in community and the well-intentioned, ignorant, or
selfish actions of others can do irreparable harm to all of us – and do
so, on a daily basis (Chapter 6).

In reality, we share in the common wealth of our communities and
our nation. A safe community, with good schools, public libraries,
efficient transportation systems, high speed internet for all, accessible
health care, abundant recreation, and social spaces for gathering, is
a prosperous and wealthy community. When the common wealth is
rich, so are the citizens. When the common wealth is depleted and
only the rich can afford some measure of well-being, the community
is stressed and unhealthy. Just as a chain is only as strong as its
weakest link, a nation’s common wealth must be measured by the
health and strength of its poorest community.

In reality, we share the common wealth of a healthy planet. We
breathe the same air, and drink water from a globally connected
system. We rely on the planet’s limited arable land for our food. The
healthier our planet, the healthier we will all be. We only have one
planet and we are on this big blue space ship together.

The idea of wealth and common wealth and the roles they play in
a society strays into economic and political theory. However, it intersects with monetary theory; wealth can guarantee that a money
is trustworthy – whether the wealth is owned by individuals or
governments.

NOTE ABOUT WORDS. I struggled to decide what to call the wealth of
a nation – the wealth that makes a nation rich. This is the wealth that
can be enjoyed by everyone. It is wealth that enriches all our lives. It
is the foundation of society.

Common wealth is wealth that can be owned by individuals. For
example, we are all richer when there are many food choices – grocery
stores, delis, restaurants. We are all richer when there are many
wonderful and affordable entertainment choices. We are all richer
when technological innovations make life safer and healthier.

Common wealth is wealth that can be owned by the public. For
example we are all richer when we have public parks, good roads,
excellent public services.

Common wealth is wealth that cannot be owned by anyone. For
example, we are all richer when we breathe clean air and drink
clean water. We are all richer when our arable land is enriched and
sustained. We are all richer when biodiversity and ecosystems are
healthy and sustained.

_Commonwealth_ as one word is a synonym for _republic._ It usually refers
to a political construct. Sometime it works and conveys what I mean
by the wealth of our commons. And, sometimes it doesn’t. When the
meaning can be synonymous with republic, I’ve used _commonwealth._
Otherwise I’ve opted to use the two words _common wealth._
