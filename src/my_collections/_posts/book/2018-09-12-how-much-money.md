_There is a certain proportionate quantity of money requisite to carry on
the trade of a country freely and currently; more than which would be of
no advantage in trade, and less, if much less, exceedingly detrimental to it._

— Benjamin Franklin, _The Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency,_ 1729^15

After the Great Depression, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt
took office in 1933, one quarter of the US workforce was unemployed.
A story circulated to support the value of a government initiated
stimulus. The story still drifts around the Internet.

_In the small town of Podunk nearly everyone was out of work and in debt. One
day a stranger came into town and stopped at the lone hotel. He set a $100
bill on the counter and told the innkeeper he’d like to look at the rooms before
deciding whether he wanted to stay. The Inn was empty and the rooms were
unlocked, so the innkeeper said, “Please, feel free to explore our rooms upstairs,
I have some business I must attend.”_

_The man went up to the second floor to look at the rooms. The innkeeper grabbed
the $100 bill and ran with it to the butcher and paid his overdue balance. The
butcher took it and ran to the grocer to pay his bill. The grocer took it and ran
to the farmer to pay his bill. The farmer took it and ran to pay the prostitute he’d been seeing on credit. She took the bill and ran to pay off the innkeeper for her use of his rooms. She had just slapped the $100 bill back down on the counter
paying off her debt, when the stranger descended. He said he had decided he
would not stay. Pulling some matches and a cigar out of his pocket, he lit the
$100 bill and then his cigar, saying with a wink, “It’s just a gag gift from a friend.”_

This story illustrates how a money token can be anything people
agree to use, and how an infusion of money can stimulate economic
activity. When there is the right amount of money, communities
prosper. When there is not enough or too much, some people suffer,
and some people make out like bandits. In between the creation of
money and its destruction, it circulates. How much money is the
right amount is determined by how fast and how far it circulates.
And that is a product of the goods and services available and the
corresponding buyers who want those goods and services.

## Quantity and value are relational

How much money is circulating matters. The law of supply and
demand applies to money itself; the greater the money supply in
proportion to the exchanges people want to make, the less each unit
of money is worth. When the value of a unit goes down, prices go
up, and it takes more units to buy the same item. When there is
less money in proportion, each unit of money is worth more and
prices go down.

## Quantity affects the quality and speed of transactions

The amount of money – in proportion to the number of people and
potential exchanges – determines the number and the quality of the
exchanges that are made. When money in an economy is abundant,
people buy and sell more. Money circulates faster, generating more
economic activity. People prosper, and they are more likely to have
money available for investing in new technologies.

We have seen booms in innovative technologies when the money
supply grew in proportion to the existing goods and services. These
flourishing times go back to the beginning of recorded history and
the initial invention of money itself in Mesopotamia. Periods of
technological and cultural flowering happened after China’s invention
of paper money in about 900 AD, after the Italian Medici family’s
implementation of double entry bookkeeping in the 14th century,
and after the influx of gold and silver from South America into
Europe in the 16th century. Dramatic expansion of the money supply
propelled the Renaissance, the European expansion into the Americas,
the industrial revolution, and the current development of modern
technologies. However, keep in mind these developments were not
universally good for everyone, as the money systems in place led to
genocide (e.g., the 16th century pillage of the Aztec kingdom for
gold), extremes of wealth and poverty, and the consumption of finite
natural resources. It is important to note we can have these benefits
of innovation and survive, if we choose a money system that supports
both values.

When there is less money in proportion to the number of people
and potential exchanges, we say money is tight. Economic activity is
slower; people can barely afford the necessities. Loans are difficult to
acquire and economic activity stagnates. Individuals, businesses and
governments make drastic cutbacks, sometimes causing harm that
can last decades and lifetimes. The wealthy can then take advantage
of a stagnant economy by converting their money stash into hard
assets at rock bottom prices. With fewer buyers and more valuable
money, prices slowly drop, which eventually brings people back to
spending again, fueling an expansion-contraction cycle that, like a
pump, shifts wealth from most people to a few.

### Velocity

How fast money moves around has an impact on how much money
is the right amount of money. After money is created it moves around
in an economy, used by many people in chains of transactions.
Depending on the system, a money token can circulate for a short
time or an infinite time before being extinguished. If a significant
number of people, or a small number of people with enormous
wealth, stop spending and instead hang onto their money, then the
amount of money in circulation will drop, and the unit value will go
up. Some money systems have built in a deliberate drop in the value
of money to encourage people to spend it and keep it circulating.
There is a balancing point, where the amount of money circulates
freely with a modicum of saving that maintains a consistent value
of money.

### Entry point

How new money enters the economy matters, because the how
will decide the where and the where will determine velocity and
accessibility. If new money goes directly to citizens, nearly all of
it will be spent and circulate, increasing the amount of money in
circulation and spurring general economic activity. If new money
goes to businesses outside the financial sector that use the money for
capital improvements or purchases of new equipment, or to pay their employees, the money will circulate and add to the money supply. If
new money goes to banks to shore up poor balance sheets, then it
will not increase the money in circulation. If money goes to a wealthy
few who will use it for gaming in the financial sector and for buying
control over crucial global commodity supplies, it will not touch
down on Main Street. The latter two are what usually happens in the
US and explains why most people have not seen much recovery since
the last meltdown in 2008.

## Recent History

### Too much

If Goldilocks stepped into our economy in early 2007 (or early 2018),
she would have found a nation with too much money. She would
have found some prices had been jumping up by over 10 percent
annually for several years. The average price of new homes in the US
increased by 70 percent in the ten years from 1997 to 2007 according
the Census Bureau.^16 Banks were using software to calculate mortgage
risks that did not include the possibility of falling prices. People were
giddy about home buying and loans were so easy to get, you didn’t
need any paperwork documenting your income for many loans.
Banks were practically begging folks to borrow against their home.
Where did all the money come from?

We currently have a system in which the money supply grows every
time a bank issues a loan. The banks were giddily issuing mortgage
loans and an overabundance of money pushed the price of homes up
further and further, fueling an asset bubble. Interest rates were so low,
it felt like free money! Since the value of your home was going up
so fast, you were really just taking out some equity, they said in their
loan pitch. People took out this equity and most of the increases in
spending in the decade from 1996 to 2006, described as our booming
economy, were a result of this borrowing, not the creation of new
jobs, innovation or increases in productivity.

When we have too much money in proportion to the products and
services in an economy, the value of each unit of money goes down and prices go up. This is what happened in the decade preceding
the 2007 crash. This is called inflation because the supply of money
is inflated – think of an expanding balloon as a metaphor – and
because the price of goods and services go up. When price inflation is
exuberant it is called a bubble. Almost any time the price of an asset
class is growing rapidly, you know bankers are on the loose.

### Too little

If Goldilocks stepped into our economy in 2009, she would have
found a nation with too little money available to Main Street.
Banks cut back the credit lines of businesses and individuals, under
government requirements that they only issue sound loans – standard
practice in a healthy economy. Businesses closed and people were
out of work. With fewer working, tax collections dropped and
government at every level had less to spend. Critical services were
cut back, putting more people out of work. Individuals, businesses,
and cities sold off their assets for less than their worth just to survive.
Those who had accumulated wealth and/or had the power to create
or borrow new money snapped up the deals. It was a massive
shift of wealth from individuals and the common wealth to a few
extraordinarily privileged and wealthy people.

Where did all the money go on Main Street? It was extinguished
when loans were repaid, and new loans were not issued to make up
the difference. While most people were scrimping and hurting, the
transfer of wealth from Main Street working folks to Wall Street
manipulators was on the fast track. Between 2007–2011 – the most
difficult years of the recent depression – the central Federal Reserve
bank (Fed) loaned the big banks and financial players over $16.1
trillion which they used to buy stocks, bonds, municipal properties
and revenue streams, commodity sources, and entire communities
of housing.^17 That’s ‘T’ for TRILLION, more than the entire volume
of economic activity in the nation in the year 2011 when the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) was $15,319.^18 More on this wealth transfer
machine in [Chapter 6.65–6.72.](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-6)

When we have too little money in proportion to the products and

services in an economy, the value of the money goes up – it takes less
money to buy goods and services. This is called deflation, because the
supply of money is deflated and the prices go DOWN.

### Just right

So, what does it look like when we have just the right amount of
money in the economy? That depends on the system and the values.

If you value privilege for the wealthy, then the right amount of
money is a supply that increases at a faster rate than population
and productivity. This over-creation of money reduces its value over
time, and a wealthy few will be best able to take advantage of newly
issued money at its highest value, and this steady reduction in its
value. Money that will be worth less next week motivates people to
borrow and spend today rather than save for tomorrow. This increase
in spending benefits those who issue loans and, short-term, it benefits
the owners of businesses (who see an increase in business). However,
a system that overall privileges the wealthy few, shifts wealth into
their hands and creates hardship and scarcity for everyone else
[(Chapter 6).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-6/) In a decreasing value money system, the _right_ amount of
money is enough to cause a slow and steady drop in its value.

Diminishing value money is the deliberate choice of most money
systems globally: a steady devaluation of the money at about
1–3 percent is considered optimum, though most of the countries
choosing steady devaluation have been running in the 5–8 percent
devaluation range for the past century – and simply changing the way
they measure devaluation to push the numbers into their sweet spot.
In the US, our Federal Reserve System declares 2 percent devaluation
of the dollar to be optimum.^19

If you value an equitable system that privileges no one, then the
right amount of money is an amount that keeps the value of money
stable over time, so changes in price truly reflect market supply and
demand, added value, or the impact of innovation. Money with a
stable value privileges no one, and gives no one undue influence over
the marketplace.

## So, how do we arrive at the right amount of money?

What criteria could we use to determine how much money is right?

### What do we value?

First we must ask, what do we value and will those values be
preserved in our choices?

Our values will determine whether we want money with an elastic
value that privileges some and punishes others. Some people believe
that people of wealth – people with capital – should be privileged,
and if we want to give special privileges to those of great wealth, we
must pick a money system that supports this value – and, up until
now, that is exactly what we have done.

However, our US Constitution establishes _“all men are created equal,”_
which means no one should have special privilege under the law. A
practical expression of this value would be a stable value money
system that shifts the choice of winners and losers in the economy
to the open marketplace. Our Constitutional values and our money
system choice are currently out of alignment.

Here are some basic considerations.

#### POPULATION

Assume one has the right amount of money to begin. If one wants to
keep prices stable and remove the benefits and burdens of changes in
the money supply, then as a population increases, there will need to
be more money to keep the supply in proportion to the number of
people using it.

#### PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPROVING LIFE STYLES

We didn’t need to budget for a car in horse and buggy days...or
budget for a cell phone when the only way to communicate was by post. As we innovate, people need more money in circulation to pay
for improvements to our lifestyles and standard of living.

#### INNOVATION

Innovation requires mistakes, and mistakes can mean waste. We need
some slop in the money supply, so innovators have access to money
to blow on the mistakes that lead to breakthrough technologies.

#### NATURAL DISASTERS AND REBUILDING

When a hurricane hits and destroys billions of dollars in assets, it
may be necessary to increase the money supply to afford rebuilding
and repairs.

#### RESILIENCE

In general, this section addressed the right amount of money for
a mono-money – a single national money system. Later, we’ll
examine evidence showing a secondary money system, or a variety of
complementary systems, lends strength to an economy. More about
this in [Chapter 4.38.](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-4/section-38)

## The Choice

So, IF, one wants a fixed measuring stick money system and an
equitable playing field economy, then when new money is created
and moved into the economy it must represent increases in the
population and/or increases in productivity and value created, with
a pinch for mistakes along the way to innovation, and a pinch to
manage disasters.

If one wants a system that privileges some and not others, then
choosing an elastic measure money system is the right choice. The
same considerations apply; we create either too much money or too
little money so supply and demand will alter money’s value.
