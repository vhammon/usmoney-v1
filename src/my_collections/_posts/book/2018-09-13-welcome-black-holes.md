Look at the slope of the exponential curve. Our rate of money
creation means roughly half the new money created is more than a
healthy – rather than feverish – economy can absorb. There is not
enough population growth, not enough increase in spending and
productivity, not enough increase in borrowing to absorb all the new
money created. So, money is wasted to support the level of growth
the system dictates. We waste money in small ways and big ways. We
toss it down black holes.

## Waste it!

It helps the economy to waste a lot.

### Food
We waste and throw away about 30–40 percent of our food. Families
throw out about 25 percent of the food and beverages we buy, and the
rest is lost in the chain from production to retail.^46

Processing foods adds to economic activity, and as we are slow to
learn, wastes crucial nutrients. We know some of the processes that
make processed food cheap also add tiny bits of toxins. This leads
to preventable disease and early death. This is a waste of life. But,
when you buy whole organic foods at a farmer’s market and cook at
home, it requires only a couple money transactions – and this is bad
in our money system. Consequently, we make it very hard for the
organic farmer, who must submit plans, pass inspections and report
on monitoring.^47 In contrast, our government heavily subsidizes big
chemical dependent agriculture to the tune of $13 billion in 2016.^48
That’s double what we spent on th EPA.

### Clothing

Buying good quality to last doesn’t generate as much economic
activity as an abundance of cheap clothes. So we buy cheap and
throw away a lot. According to the Environmental Protection Agency,
in 2014, we discarded 16 million tons of textiles, and only recycled
3 million tons. Clothing materials – rubber, leather and textile –
account for 11 percent of total landfilled waste. That’s 100 pounds of
discarded clothing for every person every year.^49

### Store it!

We stuff our houses and a mushrooming personal storage industry
with the excess we consume. Prior to 1950 self-storage facilities barely
existed. As of 2018, there were about 50,000 facilities with 2.3 billion
square feet of storage – a good size closet of 18 square feet for every
household in the country.^50 Stuff. How much do we need?

### Trash

There is good news. While in 2014 we generated 258 million tons of
waste – 1,600 pounds per person, we recycled or composted over 89
million tons. Another 33 tons was combusted for energy recovery.
We’re getting better at reuse-recycle.^51

And, then there’s some bad news. Increasingly the countries that
have been taking our stuff for recycling do not want it anymore. My
hometown, Portland, Oregon, even with recycling, has been sending
one million tons of waste to a landfill every year – roughly 3,300
pounds per person. That’s almost double the national average. Shame
on us, Portland! And, last year China said they will no longer take
our recycling, so the amount landfilled is increasing.^52

All the effort, materials, and energy that goes into making, discarding,
trashing-reusing-recycling is largely an unnecessary frenzy and waste.
Less would be more. But, if everyone purchased high quality, long-
lasting, minimally packaged goods that met their needs without waste
and excess, our economy would stall. We have become a nation of
bloated wasters under pressure to absorb extra money created every
year, and to achieve the growth imperative our system demands. This
is a choice, not a necessity.

## Broken windows

Money is guzzled when natural disasters strike; wealth and earning
power are destroyed. Recovery from a big disaster soaks up more
than just excess; it siphons away money that might have been used
elsewhere. It’s a win for the bankers because when money shifts
to recovery, people and businesses need to borrow to cover the
downturn in their business.

Not all broken windows and natural disasters are accidents. We
knowingly invest very little in prevention to keep us safe. Prevention
is always cheaper than crisis management. However, prevention
requires an upfront investment that cuts into short term profits
and cash on hand for speculation in the market-casino. So, overall,
our society makes prevention the last priority in the budget. When
spending is cut on prevention, more money must be spent on crisis
management and remediation. And sadly, we make this choice again
and again, leaving many people and our infrastructure unnecessarily
broken. Did you know:

- We spend more on prisons than schools. We now have more
    people behind bars than any other nation on the planet – EVER!
And a year in prison costs taxpayers more than a year in an Ivy
League University.^53 54 In contrast the Netherlands has closed 32
prisons since 2009 because they weren’t needed.^55
- We spend more on health care than any other nation – double
    the next highest countries, and 18 percent of the US GDP.
Among the 10 highest income countries, we have the lowest life
expectancy, the highest percentage of residents without basic
medical coverage, and highest infant mortality rate.^56
- We spend more on special education than we spend on parent
    education and support, or on assuring children’s food supply
    and environments are free of the poverty and poisons that
    compromise their development. In 2000, we spent $50 billion
    on special education, and $7 billion on the environmental
protection that would reduce the number of children needing
remedial help. This ratio likely applies in 2017, too.^57 58
- We have let our bridges and highways deteriorate to the point
    that we are in danger when driving to work.

## Black holes: perpetual poverty, disease, violence, and war

### Poverty

In our particular money system, poverty is good. People in poverty,
or an increasingly strained middle class, are more likely to borrow
for necessities and become debt slaves. Poor people are likely to be
in distress, afraid, and make bad decisions. And bad decisions cost
more money.

The poor ultimately cost more: children in poverty cost more to
educate, cost more to keep healthy, and cost more to support when
they can’t function well as adults. Currently 30 percent of American
children would be living in poverty without some government
assistance – even though most of their parents are working! With
government assistance, this percentage drops to 19 percent – 14
million children.^59 60 So, roughly one in five of America’s children are
poor, going hungry and getting a lousy start in life – a waste, and a
recipe for a more costly future.

Allowing 20 percent of our children to live in poverty and hunger is
a shameful way to treat America’s future. However, in our current
system this is all good, which makes a war on poverty a futile exercise — help one family and another falls into its place.

### Our health and our lives

Our food system and industrial systems waste lives. Our system
prioritizes growth and profits. So we allow businesses to create
preventable illness with their practices because we don’t want to slow
down their profit-making enterprises. This wastes lives.

Our current money system requires prioritizing profits and increasing
the size of our economy. So, in many cases, we avoid even testing to
see whether a product will cause harm. In its history, the EPA has
mandated safety testing for about one percent of the 85,000 industrial
chemicals available for use today – and only banned a handful.^61

#### TOXIC PRODUCTS

Our body care products, household cleaners, upholstery, bedding,
and electronic products often have chemicals in or on them that have
been shown to cause harm – or they simply haven’t been tested to
assure that they are safe.^62

Room _fresheners_ are a case in point. Ignore a dirty room and freshen
the air with proprietary big molecules that capture the odors and
drop them to the ground. Spray your kids’ rooms with _fresh_ scents.
Then put your baby on the floor. Is it safe? We do not know, officially.
But what does common sense tell us? Fewer than 10 percent of
volatile ingredients in air fresheners are typically disclosed on labels
and safety data sheets.^63

When my oldest granddaughter was born in 2003, I called Johnson
& Johnson to ask about phthalates in their plastic baby bottles. I was
passed from person to person, who all claimed they knew nothing
about phthalates in plastic. All emphasized they were a _family
company_ and would never harm children. Two years later in 2005, J&J
admitted its baby bottles had phthalates and announced with fanfare
that they were virtuously finding substitutes. This is decades after the
research on their danger was readily available to scientists. The good
news is that by 2018, they were taking more unhealthy chemicals out
of all their baby products. Europe’s early ban on these chemicals, the
efforts of many to educate the US public, and raised consumer voices
made this happen.

#### INDUSTRIAL TOXINS

Some industrial processes use dangerous chemicals. _Our Stolen Future:
Are we threatening our fertility, intelligence, and survival? A Scientific
Detective Story_ by Theo Colborn, Dianne Dumanoski, and John
Peterson Myers (1997) is a compendium of research and evidence
to that date showing chemical pollution is shrinking penises and
sperm counts, messing with the development of our children and
killing us slowly with disease.^64 We’re 20 years further down this road.
We’ve made agonizingly slow progress to clean up our industry and
commerce.

#### POLLUTION

Beyond the lawful use of chemicals, a few extraordinarily wealthy
people have records of killing people by ignoring unsafe work
conditions and pollution discharge in the industrial plants they
own. For example, the very wealthy Koch brothers are heavy
polluters. Their company is one of only three that rank among the
top 30 polluters of America’s air, water, and climate.^65 They use their
enormous wealth to fight, remove, and ignore regulations that protect
the environment, their employees and their neighbors. They are very
rich – one of the ten richest families in the world. They often win.

Their successful argument is that comprehensive testing for product
safety would hamper job creation and profits. Hence the _1976 Toxic
Substances Control Act_ requires the EPA to first have evidence of harm
before it can demand a chemical be tested for safety – a catch-22.

Update & good news: In June 2016, H.R.2576, _The Frank R.
Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act_ was passed nearly
unanimously by Congress. This law shifts the burden of proof of
safety onto businesses, and strengthens the EPA’s ability to require
testing of chemicals.

Update & bad news: Scientific American reports that the Trump
administration was tasked with writing the rules for how the EPA will
implement this new law. There are concerns that their rules seriously
subvert the law’s purpose in favor of industry, since they have stated
that is their plan.^66

And, the worst news: Republicans who now control Congress and the
Executive branch, tell us they are committed to doing away with the
EPA and as many nationwide protections as they can. And, they’re doing it. According to the US Government Financial Reports, the
2016 EPA’s already inadequate net cost was $8.6 billion. In 2017 the
Republican Congress cut the net cost to $8.4 billion. The 2018 Budget
is $5.66 billion – a 33 percent cut. President Trump’s proposed 2019
budget requests $5.4 billion for the EPA – another cut.^67 68

Our GDP is nearly $19,000 billion. To spend one tenth of one
percent on safety standard setting, monitoring, and compliance, we
would have to _increase_ the EPA budget to $19 billion, instead of
cutting it to under $6 billion. Would that really be excessive? What
is a reasonable cost for safety assurance? When we ignore safety the
costs increase and fall on the public and taxpayers. Bankers benefit.

#### AGRICULTURAL TOXINS

For scale, efficiency and higher profits, Big Agriculture uses chemical
pesticides and fertilizers. Monsanto and other companies have
developed genetically engineered crops that allow heavier and heavier
applications of chemicals – increasing usage exponentially.

Some businesses like Monsanto have deliberately ignored their own
research that says their products do harm. They’ve gone a step further
and spent millions to attack and discredit independent research
agencies that find their products are cancer-causing.^69 With mounting
evidence of their deliberate deceit and killing-for-profit, Monsanto’s
GMOs have been banned by government in 38 countries.^70

To increase yields and profits, in 2011 US chemical-additive farmers
used 46,297 million pounds of fertilizer. The most recent data from
2007, says they used another 877 million pounds of _active_ ingredients
(herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and other pesticides).^71 Very little,
if any, testing has been done on the impact of cocktails of micro
portions of these active ingredients on human development and life.

Farmers in America use about 30 million pounds of antibiotics on
their animals, 90 percent of it used to make the animals put on
weight faster.^72 This increases the private owners’ profits, but shifts
an enormous burden of ill health onto Americans. According to the
Centers for Disease Control, almost 250,000 people each year require hospital care for antibacterial resistant infections. At least 14,000 of
them die.^73 In 2008, Tufts University estimated these infections cost
about $20 billion in excess direct healthcare costs, with additional
costs to society for lost productivity as high as $35 billion a year.^74
But, in our system, this extra spending counts as a desirable increase
in our GDP.

#### COMPROMISED HEALTH

Chemical pesticides are in our water, our food supply, and our bodies.
Today we have chemicals in our systems, including DDT, flame
retardants, substances used to make non-stick pans, phthalates, and a
variety of chemicals found in many beauty products and plastics.^75 76

There is a price to pay for ingesting tiny bits of herbicides that kill
off your gut flora, and tiny bits of pesticides that disrupt body
functions.^77 These chemicals are designed to disrupt life process and
kill. These chemicals can cause birth defects, developmental delays
and early death.

Our bodies are beyond the safe limits for absorption of chemical
toxins. After decades of increasing longevity, life expectancy is now
getting shorter in the US. The United Health Foundation’s 2016
Annual Report ranked the US 26th of 35 OECD countries for life
expectancy and 29th for infant mortality. We spend twice as much
as the next biggest spender on health care. Our poor outcomes are a
clear indication that private profits are outweighing risks to our lives.^78

We are near the limits of Earth’s capacity to absorb and process waste
and pollution. Over 85,000 chemicals are available for use. Most
are tested to see if you’ll die if you drink them. Only about one
percent are tested to see if they harm us in small quantities over years — or in combination over the short term. Even fewer are tested for
    their impact on fish, wildlife and the comprehensive food chain.^79
    However, Hawaii had enough data on the impact of sunscreens
       on coral reefs and sea life to ban those containing oxybenzone and
       octinoxate. Bravo Hawaii!^80

### Violence

Money is soaked up by endemic fear that generates violence. Weapon
makers admit their sales go up every time there is a mass shooting.
They salivate over higher profits when violence increases in the world.
In the US, the money interests have successfully made laws that ban
using government money to study the causes of gun violence so we
could make smarter and better informed choices to prevent it. In
2018, Republicans are still supporting the 22-year ban on gun violence
research.^81

In 2012, there were enough applications for gun ownership in the
US to stock NATO troops five times. Over 16 million people apply for
a gun license every year, and only a few hundred are refused.^82 We
have the highest gun ownership in the world, with 89 guns for every
100 residents. (Yemen is next with 55).^83 Out of 196 countries, 165
countries do better on gun related deaths than the US. In 2016 we
had 3.85 deaths due to gun violence per 100,000 people – no record
to be proud of or to ignore.^84

Gun violence costs an immeasurable amount. Guns were used in
14,925 homicides and 22,938 suicides in 2016. Guns were used either
intentionally or accidentally to wound 81,114 people every year on
average from 2011–1015. On average, seven of our children are killed
with guns every day. Many people and communities are changed by
grief, fear, violence and death.^85 Our police are on record killing an
average of one to three of us every single day.^86 They are accepting
battle gear from the Defense Department, and say they shoot to
kill because they fear for their own lives.^87 When violent crime is
at an all-time low, what is all this about? Fear makes people easy to
manipulate.^88

Yet equipping our civilians for war is a drop in the bucket compared
to how much we spend on equipping our military and militaries all
over the world.

### War

War creates enormous expense and consequent debt. It has long been
a means of keeping a government in debt to the money power. In the
1790s, private investors in the first official Bank of the United States
tried unsuccessfully to engage the US in wars with the northern
native Americans, then with Britain, with Algiers, then France. They
hoped the government would lose its shares in the bank to war
debt.^89 We avoided the wars they were promoting, but this practice
of promoting war has gone on with increasing success ever since.
The US has engaged in one war or another for 215 of our 236 years
as a nation. And the bankers ultimately succeeded in keeping the
government from having any share of the bankers money-creation
privilege.

In 2016, the world spent about $1,688 billion on military equipment –
2.24 percent of world GDP and $221 for every person on the planet.^90
The US accounts for one third or more of these global expenditures.
The $611 billion we spent in 2016 was more than the total spent by
the next eight biggest spenders combined.^91 The GOP, controlling
all branches of government beginning in 2017, increased our military
spending to $700 billion – a 15 percent one year increase, then $717
for 2018.

We are the world’s largest arms dealer and military solution promoter.
The US accounts for 34 percent of total arms exports. Since 1971
we’ve had an agency within the Department of Defense (DoD), The
Defense Security Cooperation Agency, to promote foreign military
sales and international military education and training. Up through
2014, its budget was included in the financial reports of the DoD. In
2015, this agency became a separate line entry, making it easier to see
what the US spends to promote the use of a military as a solution to
the world’s conflicts: our government spent an average of $37 billion
each year from 2015–1017.^92

The Obama administration loosened restrictions on sales, and from
2012 to 2016, US arms sales increased by 21 percent.^93 The Trump
administration further relaxed customer requirements and is making
more arms sales a key component of its foreign policy.^94 In 2017, the
US State Department set a new one-year record for clearing weapons
sales, with $76 billion cleared and more than $50 billion going to the
Middle East.^95

This is good for the bankers, because the more war and destruction,
the more borrowing for munitions, for reconstruction, and for
crippled lives.

Imagine what the world would be like if we invested that $37 billion
every year training people to communicate across cultural divides,
to solve problems by looking at underlying issues and goals, and
to practice win-win negotiation. This would cost a tiny fraction of
what we spend on mopping up after attempts at military solutions to
global problems. And we would have a radically improved chance of
a peaceful world. But, this would not soak up as much money, and
that’s a problem in our system. It would also require an alteration of
our general worldview from a dominator to a partnership model.

I’ve lived long enough to sense the rhythm of the drums of war.
Government debt MUST increase to keep pace with the new money
created in the private sector, but many misunderstand this and lobby
effectively for cutting back the federal budget while allowing the
banks to go on a money creation spree.

This creates an untenable imbalance. When Congress cuts
expenditures in the mistaken belief that eliminating government
debt will strengthen the economy, the extra money the private sector
creates must go somewhere. And, what better way to waste money
than to go to war? President Bill Clinton cut spending and reduced
the deficit while deregulating Wall Street. Next, President G.W.Bush
started a war that ran up trillions in debt. Then, Obama cut spending
and reduced the deficit and allowed the bankers to continue their
mostly unfettered money creation.

Now the drums of war are beating again. “Bomb, bomb Iran.” Carpet
bomb Syria!” “Bomb any country with angry Muslims!” or “Bomb
North Korea!”

When wasting money is needed, perpetual war is the supreme black
hole solution. We know better. We know beating your wife and kids
is no way to raise a healthy family. We know jack-booted police with
military weapons is no way to police a healthy community. We know
_shock and awe_ bomb dropping is a foolish and ineffective way to bring
peace to a region of the world.

I’d like to think, though, when we make decisions from our wisest
selves, we know war is no solution. There are plenty of preventive
strategies we know work and just need to choose them. But we are
pushed by the money system toward the black hole of war.
