Our money creation system creates hard times by design in several
ways. It creates artificial scarcity which results in a highly competitive,
fear-driven economy. And, unfettered exploitation of natural
resources creates real scarcity. It creates boom-bust cycles, driven
by speculators and hormones that benefit a few at the expense of
the many.

Hard times are here now. According to the 2014 Gallup-Healthways
Global Well-Being Index, only 24 percent of adults in the US are
thriving in social well-being, only 22 percent in financial well-being,
41 percent in community well-being, and 31 percent in physical well-being. The US ranks 23rd. We come in well behind our neighbors, #1.
Panama, and #2. Costa Rica.<sup>96</sup> In every category at least six out of ten
of our citizens – the heart of our commonwealth – are only getting by
or suffering.

## Intentional scarcity

Our money supply is all someone’s debt. It carries an interest
burden. The only way there can be enough money in the system to
pay principle and interest is for someone else to expand the money
supply by borrowing more. Then we must compete to grab enough
of the new money to pay our expenses and our debts and the interest
on them. This creates a musical chairs situation. We’re working as
hard as we can to get enough. But, the system _by its nature_ never has
enough for all of us.

In our system, if there is more for you, there is less for me. This
creates a stressful and highly competitive work environment. Fear
drives us – fear that we won’t be able to grab a share for ourselves and
our families. It pushes people towards, _“It’s mine!”_ instead of _“How
can we take care of each other and our commonwealth?”_ It pushes us to
pick someone lower on the economic ladder to step on and it is at the
root of racism and xenophobia.

Some argue the interest on money creation can come out of the
churn of money. As a money unit moves around in the economy, it
takes a little nip into the bankers’ interest collection pool and nips
right back out again – no real draw on the economy. After all, the
bankers will spend their profits and the money will continue to cycle.
But, this is a rationalization of privilege by the money interests. Of
course it draws from the economy. What must be dropped into the
bankers’ interest-on-newly-created-money bucket is not available
on Main Street for other productive purposes; it tends to pool in
offshore accounts or it buys assets and control of future income
streams. It shorts everyone but the bank owners, increasing people’s
need to borrow. It is that giant straw described in [Chapter 2.7.](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-2/section-7)

## Exploitation creates more scarcity

We’ve created real scarcities of many natural resources – drinking
water, watersheds, bird refuges, forests and oxygen-producing trees,
arable land for farming – through economic practices that demand
growth and profits at the expense of long-term sustainable life
[(Chapter 6.67).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-6/section-67)

At the same time, those with the money power control our laws so
they can extract from the common wealth at very little expense to
themselves. While our aquifers shrink beyond life-sustaining levels,
big corporations extract water for a pittance and literally blow it
into the wind with wasteful agricultural practices...or use it to mist
shopping malls in Arizona...or stick it in bottles and sell it to us at
exorbitant rates. Water was once abundant. Our water was free to all
and we just paid for getting it to our faucets. Now water is becoming
truly scarce – and moving into the monetized private sector. We’re
making this true for all our natural resources and seeding even harder
times to come.
