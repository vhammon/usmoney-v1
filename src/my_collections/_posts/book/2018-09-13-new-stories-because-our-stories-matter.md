_When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty... but when I
have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong._  
- Buckminster Fuller (1895–1983)

We face a daunting challenge. While the mechanics of switching to a
commonwealth money system are relatively simple and easy to accom-
plish, the fundamental shift from a greed and profit-based culture to a
culture of caring and prosperity for all is profound. It will meet with
powerful resistance.

It helps to recognize that there are glimmers of shift that support this
cultural maturation. These glimmers give us hope that we can change
our money system.

We each have stories about how the world works. Our stories frame how
we view problems and solutions. Is our story about man the conqueror - making the natural world serve our goals of economic growth and
    profits? Or, is our story about man the steward who understands inter-
    dependence and the importance of renewable resources and sustainable
    industry?

As we learn and mature our stories change. Recognizing our stories and
telling them clearly to others increases learning, understanding and
decision-making.

Our common stories about the world are changing. Dog poop is a
great example of our capacity to learn and tell a new story. When I was
growing up our story about the role of family pets was different. Most
people treated pets as outdoor animals and let their dogs out and then
let them back in again. Stepping in dog doo was common. Our story
said it was the nature of pets to poop outside, and the nature of people
to let it be. If you had stopped the average person on the street and
said everyone should take responsibility for their dogs and pick up the
poop, most people would have said, _“It will never happen.”_ But, it did.
We changed our story.

Our stories about money and how it should work are changing too.
Happily, there are several shifts happening in our common worldviews
that support a new story about how money should work:

## E Pluribus Unum

### From we are individual, separate and independent TO we are an indi-
vidual, AND we are all interconnected and interdependent.

We are shifting from a story idolizing the independence and self-suffi-
ciency of the pioneers, cowboys and the individual TO one recognizing
we’re on this continent – and planet – together. (The pioneers were
actually very _inter_ dependent and we are giving that more recognition.)

We named our country, The United States. United means joined together
for a common purpose: the general welfare – not just the individual
welfare of a few, the general welfare of us all. Our Constitution says we
intend to get together to be happy. We just haven’t quite figured out
how to do it, yet.

Today, we are aware there are many decisions we must make as a whole
nation. Lax regulations in one state pollute another. Poor highway main-
tenance in one state slows down traffic going to another. Stressed public
education in one state means poorly educated and easily manipulated
people picking our leaders. There are many decisions about the qual-
ity of our lives we must make together if we are going to reach our
goals of domestic tranquility and general welfare. The money system
is one of them.

## Dominator TO partnership

### From an authoritarian-dominator model of social organization TO a
partnership model.

### Governance

We’re changing our story about what makes the best governance. Most
societies in recorded history have been ruled by a single person – a high
priest, a pharaoh, an emperor, a general, a king or queen and their inner
circle. Our story has been that a powerful individual or a small group
of elites know what is best for everyone else.

While it is across lifetimes and an erratic path, over the past millennia,
our story about who rules best has been changing – from a powerful,
charismatic leader to a group of powerful and charismatic elites, to the
distributed and aggregated wisdom of a whole community.

Our story is shifting from valuing an authoritarian rule to valuing egal-
itarian rule – aggregating the wisdom of an independent, informed,
diverse public in issue-based problem-solving and conflict resolution.
Our Constitution is a milestone on this path toward governing of, by
and for a people. Our 2016 election may make this seem like a fantasy,
but when you consider hundreds of years of history, the shift is appar-
ently happening.

This new story is changing our relationship to government. Instead of
government by _them,_ our emerging story is about government by _us._
This new story is not about government as a distinct and oppositional
power, _“...that forces me to do things, like pay taxes and use the national
money.”_ It is a story saying, _“As a responsible citizen I do my part to be
informed and to participate in civil discourse and decision-making and I
share in the benefits and responsibilities of being a citizen.”_ This new story
reflects an understanding that good governance is a collaborative effort.
We have a way to go before we’re good at it, and we could accelerate
our learning should we choose.

The speed of this story change is accelerating as it spreads into many
areas of life. These changes are happening slowly, gradually, and some-
times it seems like we’re going in reverse, but looking back over a lifetime,
they are happening surely.

### Parenting

We’re shifting from a story saying father always knows best and it’s
OK to use physical force and verbal abuse to enforce his dictates, TO
a parenting model balancing firm limits with respect for parents _and_
the individual child’s needs. In this emerging story it is important that
parents help children learn _self-_ discipline, compassion for others, and
confidence in their ability to make a positive contribution with their
lives. We are increasingly interested in developing good human beings
instead of just raising obedient wage earners or authoritarian talent.

### Personal growth

We’re shifting from saying a pastor, counselor or therapist should tell
you what is wrong with you and how to fix it. The emerging story
values someone who listens, asks good questions and helps you figure
things out for yourself. We increasingly value those who teach us how
to understand relationship dynamics and how to make good decisions
for ourselves, more than those who tell us what to do.

### Education

We’re shifting from a story valuing the teacher who stands at the front of
rows of desks lecturing, who tests on regurgitating pre-selected informa-
tion, TO a story about teachers who guide students to learn how to learn
and be a critical thinker. Montessori education has been on the fore-
front of this shift for more than 100 years, and has helped lead this shift.

### Conflict resolution

We are shifting from intimidating power, my-way or highway, adver-
sarial, winner-take-all, horse-trading, unprincipled favor exchanging,
decision-from-on-high methods, TO mutual respect, mediation and
negotiation strategies that are issue-based and aim for win-win solutions.

### Agriculture

We are shifting from industrial scale factory farming that depletes and
poisons the land. These farmers dominate their fields with force feed-
ing and pharmaceuticals to make plants and animals grow faster and
bigger. We are shifting back TO organic farming which first builds the
quality of its soil, acting in partnership with the natural world. Organic
farmers produce safer food of higher nutritional value, _and_ improve the
land for future use.

### Economics

We’re shifting from accepting that some people should be able to exploit
others to make profits for a few owners, TO recognizing businesses
that give employees a stake in the profits and pay living wages are _more_
successful – even for the owners, and certainly for society as a whole.
We’re shifting from trusting that a small elite of very wealthy people,
devoted to their own self-interest, will make innovation happen, and
create jobs resulting in general prosperity, TO trusting that when a
nation, together, focuses on creating, and maintaining a strong, healthy
common wealth, a vibrant economy will naturally follow.

### Money

We’re shifting from believing a private banking elite will determine the
right amount of money and pick the best entry point for new money, TO
believing a diverse, independent and informed citizenry will best make
these determinations. Conversations about this fundamental change
are happening all over the planet. This shift from a dominator model
to a partnership model of money creation will improve and protect our
common wealth, which will result in a prosperous economy.

## No pain-no gain TO pain reduces gains

### From a no pain-no gain mindset TO the power of prevention and caring.

There is an old idea that like steel tempered in fire, people who live
through difficult circumstances come out stronger. There is some truth
to this. We do learn and grow through difficult situations. However,
none of us deliberately make life a living hell for our kids in hopes they
will be better adults. We nurture them with care and love, the best food,
the best home and education we can provide. We don’t send them out
to work at the age of five and make them live off their earnings, because
we know that would not give them the best start. This doesn’t mean
we protect our children from the pain of failure; it means we recognize
a healthy and strong foundation makes for a healthy and strong and
productive adult. We know, the better the beginning the more likely a
child will reach their fullest potential.

So, where do we get the idea this is not true for adults? The evidence
says employees are more productive when they are respected, well paid
and have some control over their tasks. Evidence says unemployed and
homeless people are more likely to get back on their feet when they are
given a roof over their heads and a stipend for basic living expenses –
even if they are on drugs.^2 Evidence says lawbreakers are more likely
to become good citizens when they are given an education, drug treat-
ment and healthcare.^3

But when it comes to our communities and our economy, there is an
old belief that life should be hard for people in poverty or at the begin-
ning of their careers. Poverty and the need to work exceptionally hard
to survive will be an incentive to work enough to rise up the economic
ladder. Poverty will make them stronger. For some, that may be.

However, we are learning that a public foundation of support does not
create dependency; it creates health, well-being and prosperity. Many
other nations have proven when people have the security of knowing
any health needs will be covered, they are healthier and more produc-
tive. When people get the education they want, they learn more and
are more productive in the economy. When people have time off to
nurture family ties they come back to work refreshed and more produc-
tive. When we make sure all our nation’s children have health care from
conception to adulthood, and make sure a good education is available
to all, there will be less disease, less crime, less mental illness. The nation
will prosper and need to spend less on crisis and remediation. It takes
a shift in thinking.

Mostly, we recognize that a good foundation makes for greater produc-
tivity and happiness. There is plenty of pain and suffering in life without
our deliberately adding to it. But we have been trained to accept the idea
that poverty, pain and suffering are part of a natural order. This natural
order justifies exploiting others and natural resources for personal gain.
So, if some people must suffer so we can do well, then so be it. We strive
to be one of the lucky ones who come out on top. But, thankfully, this
essentially heartless creed is on the wane.

## Tough competition TO nurture & collaboration

### From competition is the only way to progress TO collaboration has the
greatest benefits.

Our old story overvalues competition because that is what our money
system requires. Stressful competition is promoted for life’s basics,
including money itself – we are driven to grab what we can for ourselves
and our loved ones, even at the expense of others. This increases true
scarcity for many.

People do extraordinary things under enormous pressure. And, yes, a few
rugged individuals rise from rags to riches. Yes, some people stretch to
their finest potential when challenged by competition. However, people
do their consistent best when in the zone – healthy, rested, primed, and
energized. The most successful competitions generally are those between
teams of people, because teams of people support and nurture each other
and give each other strength to compete.

Adults produce their best work when they are well-rested and in good
company. High stress reduces productivity.^4 Only a very few people
thrive under constant stress. Most of us do our best when we are
nurtured. According to a Harvard study, over 600,000 people in the
US go bankrupt from medical bills every year.^5 Think of the stress and
anxiety! In Britain, France, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada
and Switzerland, NO ONE goes broke because of medical bills. Think
about that freedom to heal and get on with life after a serious illness.
Think about the benefit to society as a whole. How can pill-popping,
sleep-deprived America measure up to that?

When we are confident our basic needs will be met, we are more creative
and more productive. And, we are less inclined to grab for all we can
get. This reduces the number of people who face preventable suffering.

## There’s not enough to go around TO there’s enough for everyone

### From there’s not enough to go around so some must suffer TO we have
enough for everyone.

_There is enough for everyone. People think that there isn’t enough, so they
get as much as they can. Then many people don’t have enough._  
— R. Buckminster Fuller

We have enough for everyone on earth to prosper. It is simply a matter
of more equitable distribution. Think of the eight richest people in the
world who now have more wealth than the poorest half – 3,500,000,
combined. They only wear one pair of pants at a time just like the rest
of us. They won’t have to suffer when we distribute earth’s bounty more
equitably. Someone making billions of dollars every year can cut their
income significantly and still live better than everyone else. Isn’t there a
point where wealth becomes excessive and immoral? It is not enough to
praise this tiny minority for setting up foundations that do charity work
(or pretend to do so). It is wrong for them to be deciding how the world
overcomes hunger or provides quality education. We would get better
decisions from a much more diverse community of decision-makers.

Some people have been programmed to hear better distribution of wealth
as “hating the successful and rich.” It is important to understand this is
not the point. Only a very few truly begrudge the wealth of those who
work hard, or innovate, or build businesses. People begrudge the wealth
accumulated in a rigged system, and gained by causing harm to others.

If we truly want to prosper, we must change our story about money: a
money system can let natural abundance prevail. We can have minimum
life support for all our citizens, so we can each get on with finding and
fulfilling our highest purpose.

**Think how great America would be then!**
