_Yet few people not versed in banking ever dream that their money ‘in the bank’
is not in the bank; and few people versed in banking ever dream that the
money which is not there ought to be there, or that it is practical to have it there._\
— Irving Fisher, Economist, 1936<sup>12</sup>

An anchor provides stability or confidence in an otherwise uncertain
situation. Money created by fractional reserve is inherently uncertain
and unstable. Yet, this has been the prevailing system for hundreds
of years. What anchors this money has shrunk over time. The
next sections look at this evolution from money creation partially
collateralized with a reserve, to partially collateralized with banker
equity, to no meaningful collateralization.

By definition, in a fractional reserve money creation system there is
some money in reserve that anchors the promises made. This reserve
is there to make the money in circulation more trustworthy. Reserves
are defined as a portion of the money deposited by customers. This
is true whether the money is an IOU-receipt for a commodity or an
IOU-future value promise. In a true fractional reserve system, these
reserves anchor and constrain the money creation of the private
bankers. Bankers must first have deposits before they can create new
money. Then, they must gauge how many reserves they must keep on
hand to satisfy the demands of their customers and avoid a run on
their bank.

These deposits become the base of the money creation pyramid
described in [Chapter 4.32.](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-4/section-32) You deposit $100, the bank puts $10 on
reserve and loans out the other $90. The borrower deposits the $90
and the bank puts $9 on reserve and loans out another $81. The
borrower deposits the $81 and the bank adds $8.10 to its reserves and loans out another $72.90. It keeps doing this until it has created
$1,000 in new money that is circulating with only $100 on reserve.
The required reserve ratio limits the amount of new money that can
be created and earn interest for the bankers.
In a truly fractional reserve money creation system, the deposits from
customers serve as a control on how much new money can be created.
The reserves are generally small in proportion to the money banks
create anew.

Some authority decides what the ratio of reserves must be to the new
money created. It may be that a private, independent bank judges
from its own experience that keeping 20 percent on hand will protect
it from any run on the bank. It may be that a private central bank
demands its cartel members maintain a certain reserve to assure all
members are sound. It may be a government that says all the nation’s
banks must maintain a reserve of a specific amount. Historical
reserves have ranged from almost nothing to almost 90 percent.

In a fractional reserve money creation system, the reserve ratio
determines how much new money a bank can create. For example,
if banks must maintain a 10 percent reserve, then they can create 10
times the money they have from depositors. If they must maintain a
one percent reserve, then they can create 100 times the money they
have from depositors. Whatever the ratio, **a fractional reserve money
creation system requires some money be deposited by the public
to anchor the creation of new money, and some of those deposits
must be held on reserve.**

## NOT OUR SYSTEM

In practice, this is not the bank system we currently have, especially
for the five or six big banks that control most of the banking business.
We have a fractional reserve system in name only. Smaller, local
and regional banks, which overall have a small share of the money
creation business, practice this model to some extent. But the big
banks have been able to manipulate the laws to the point that, for all
practical purposes, they keep nothing at all on reserve. Overall, our
banking sector’s creation of new money is not anchored by a need for
customer deposits that they multiply.

For all intents and purpose, a true reserve money creation system is
a story of the past. The money multiplier affects less than 10 percent
of the money supply (in the US), and, _“the tight link suggested by the
multiplier between reserves and money and bank lending does not exist.”_
Federal Reserve, 2010<sup>13</sup>
