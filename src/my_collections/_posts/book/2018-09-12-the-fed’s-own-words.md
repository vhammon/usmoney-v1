Here is what the Fed says about itself:

> _As the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve derives its authority from the
> Congress of the United States. It is considered an independent central bank
> because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the
> President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government,
> it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of
> the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and
> congressional terms._
>
> _However, the Federal Reserve is subject to oversight by the Congress, which
> often reviews the Federal Reserve’s activities and can alter its responsibilities
> by statute. Therefore, the Federal Reserve can be more accurately described as
> “independent within the government” rather than “independent of government.”_

The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, which were established by the Congress
as the operating arms of the nation’s central banking system, are organized
similarly to private corporations – possibly leading to some confusion about
“ownership.” For example, the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member
banks. However, owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning
stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and
ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership
in the System. The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a
loan; dividends are, by law, 6 percent per year.^16

Let’s unpack that.

### Independent

The Fed does a little dance around being _“independent within the
government”_ rather than _“independent of government.”_ Independent is
the key word. By design, Congress and the Executive Branch cannot
participate in decisions made by the Federal Reserve System.

In our democratic republic none of our duly elected branches
of government have any control over the policy decisions of our central bank and its private member banks. This is true, despite
the fact that their money-creation decisions determine our economic
well-being. Our Congress can review some of the central bank’s
activities, and can “alter its responsibilities by statute,” but today it can
have no say in the day-to-day operations and choices of our money
creation system.

The Federal Reserve System is intended to be a cabal of private
bankers, serving their own interests – primarily to make money for
their shareholders. The central bank is there to provide services to
its members, to help them when they make little mistakes, allowing
them to reduce their individual bank reserves and increase their
profits, and to bail them out when they make big mistakes. The
central bank has some statutory power to influence the decision-
making of its private member banks. However, in practice, the
independent bankers are the dogs wagging their Board of
Governors’ tail.

Until very recently, it was considered perfectly appropriate for the
central bank to do its business in secret. There is a long tradition of
this secrecy; no records at all exist for the first Bank of the US (1791–
1881).^17 Secrecy is important because our current system depends
on everyone maintaining confidence; keeping any potential pitfalls
private is a system requirement. Today the Fed produces public
reports on what is happening in the economy and financial reports
for the Federal Reserve System. However its operational policy
meetings were off limits to the public until 2009, when they began
publishing their meeting minutes three weeks after the meetings — after the decisions were made and operational. This secrecy allows the bankers to be unencumbered by any societal or political considerations so they can serve their own interests above all. Benefits will theoretically trickle down to the public and somehow the
financiers privileged accumulation of wealth will benefit the nation as
a whole. This theory is known as laissez-faire capitalism and trickle-
down economics. There is only short-term anecdotal evidence to
support this assumption. ...Think exponential pyramid scheme for
long-term outcome.

The Federal Reserve System is subject to several levels of audit and
review. Each reserve bank employs a full time staff of auditors
that report to the Board. The Board itself has an independent
internal audit staff, and an independent auditor audits the financial
statements every year. Since 1978, most of the general operations of
the Federal Reserve System became subject to review by the General
Accounting Office (GAO). However, the Fed’s Discount Window,
(which is its process of creating money by loaning it to banks), its
Open Market Operations (its process of creating or extinguishing
money by buying and selling government securities), and its
agreements with foreign banks are all off the table at audit time. That
is a substantial chunk of its core business. And, remember, an audit
is a process that checks for honesty and integrity in reporting and
accounting after the decisions have been made. An audit, even of
all its operations, policies and actions, would not impinge on the
existing legal rights of the central bank and its members to create as
much money as their confidence allows.

### Ownership

The regional Federal Reserve Banks are owned by their member banks,
which are required by the system to purchase a certain amount of
stock as a condition of membership. The amount of stock is based
on the size of the bank. The Fed allows up to half the purchase
price to be an on-call IOU. While this stock _“may not be sold, traded,
or pledged as security,”_ it will earn the member bank 6 percent per
year. Though the 12 regional banks _“are not operated for profit,”_ they
write off this 6 percent dividend to their members, as part of their
operating expenses. It comes out of the seignorage the central bank
gets for introducing its share of new money into the economy. While
this arrangement may be _“quite different from owning stock in a private
company,”_ where there is inherent risk of losing one’s investment, it is
an advantageous difference. They get a guaranteed 6 percent return –
12 percent if they are paying no interest on their stock purchase IOU,
and their membership brings all the benefits of a central bank.

Please note the Federal Reserve consistently puts ownership in
quotation marks. It claims because the member shares cannot be traded on the open market, they are somehow not claims of
ownership. That is twisting the truth. In addition to the guaranteed
6 percent return on their membership stock, the big banks get a near
guarantee they will be bailed out of any financial difficulty when they
screw up. Even extraordinary malfeasance will not be prosecuted
because doing so could cause a drop in market confidence – and, that
could cause systemic collapse. Banks get a slap on the wrist penalty
for breaking the law, and their penalty can be deducted from taxable
income as a business expense. No other type of business owner holds
this kind of privilege; a privilege not unlike the divine rights of an
absolute monarch.

## And, not in their words...

If you search on the FederalReserve.gov website for _money creation_
nothing comes up that has anything to do with the creation of new
money. If you search for _money multiplier_ which is euphemistic way
of saying new money creation in a fractional reserve system, you will
get documents about changes in the size of the money supply, and a
few comments about why the term no longer applies. The 146-page
book issued by the Federal Reserve called _The Federal Reserve System:
Purposes and Functions_ (2005) does not even once address how new
money is created and entered into the US economy. It is a study in
ignoring the gorilla in our midst. It would be like writing a book
about human sexuality and omitting information on intercourse.

So, let’s take a little closer look at the main aspects of our
current system...
