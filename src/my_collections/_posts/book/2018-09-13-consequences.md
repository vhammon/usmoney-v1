[Chapter 6](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-6) looked at the consequences of our current money system.
Now let’s consider the potential impact of a new common wealth
money system.

A stable, sovereign, 100% equity money system removes the necessity for
exponential growth in our economy. This is a critical change we must
make to remain a healthy species on the planet. Without the constant
monetary pressure to grow bigger, use more and consume more, artificial scarcity will gradually cease to exist. Real scarcity will remain. We
have already diminished many of our natural resources to the point of
scarcity. But, we will have the money to repair our natural resources and
rebuild our common wealth. This will reduce real scarcity, too.

## Equal justice and peace

We will have a money system that makes everyone equal _under the law_.
The systemic money transfer-to-the-wealthy will cease to exist. This
will go a long way toward establishing _Liberty and Justice for All_ and a
peaceful society.

With commonwealth money we can all have the basic essentials of life.
When we have enough, hyper-competition and exploitation of each
other will no longer be necessary. We can genuinely establish domestic
tranquility and move along in our pursuit of happiness. Enough can
be enough; we may cease to try to fill emptiness with purchased stuff.

We can savor craftsmanship, creativity, spirituality, quality goods, neighborliness, and plentiful family time. When each of us can strive to
achieve our fullest potential without artificial hindrance, we may not
need war to give meaning to an otherwise dreary drudge of a life.<sup>1</sup>

## A renewable economy

Without the demand for exponential growth we can establish a stable
and renewable economy. We can spend some of our money on cleaning up the mess we’ve made with resource extraction, fossil fuels and
toxic waste disposal. We can save our bees. We can do the right thing,
instead of what will make money for a few people, because everything
we do will not need to be a moneymaker. We can become good stewards
of our place on our planet, leaving it in better shape for the generations to come.

## Fewer black holes

We cannot stop natural disasters. However, with forethought and
investment we can minimize their impact. Without the overwhelming
money-system demands for short-term profits, we can make long-term
investments in prevention. We can invest in the technologies of peace,
instead of constantly feeding the war machine. We can still maintain a
military for the common defense, but we will not need to be constantly
putting it to use to promote and defend the interests of the private bankers and other special interests.

## Innovation

We will continue to innovate and develop efficiencies because this
is our nature; doing new and creative things brings us joy. Research
says money is one of the poorest motivators, and removing money
from its place as the one and only motivator will see a flowering of
creative ideas.<sup>2</sup> More time for relaxation, nurturing family connections,
random knowledge gathering, and reflection will generate creativity on
an unprecedented scale.

## An economy in equilibrium

Economy-wide cycles of boom and bust will stop. Banks will still fail,
but their failure will not cost people their deposits, nor will it take down
the entire economy. Our currency will be stable with very minor fluctuations of value. Businesses will still go through the same cycles of arising,
thriving, declining and vanishing. Individuals will still make fortunes
and keep them or blow them away. But, the entire economy will reach
a sustainable and healthy equilibrium. We can be happier and healthier and have:

**Health and prosperity;**
**A free and fair market; and**
**The best decision-making**
