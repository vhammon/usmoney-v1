Bankers and economists have made counting the money supply a
challenge. Money is defined as a tiered construct of increasingly
obscure means of issuing debt or credit. _M0_ is called the _monetary
base_ and it is the money that is on deposit at the Fed plus cash
currency. _M1_ is called _liquid money_ and it adds the deposits of bank
customers. (M0 and M1 are also called _narrow money_ .) _M2_ is called
_near-liquid money_ , and it adds savings accounts, the assets of retail
money funds, and the assets created by small certificates of deposit.
_M3_ adds long-term deposits plus the money created by institutional
money funds, foreign dollar deposits and other arcane financial
instruments. _M4_ includes all the rest of redeemable financial assets
being used as money. It is also called _MZM_ for _money with zero
maturity_ , or _shadow money_ as it includes assets that are not subject to
regulatory oversight. Together M2, M3, and M4 are also called _broad
money_. This continuum is like IOU money; then IOU an IOU; then IOU
an IOU for an IOU money, etc.

Everything up through M3 is clearly being used as money. M4 is
in the shadows so it’s difficult to fully understand how it functions.
The full count of the supply should at least include M3. However,
in 2006, the Fed decided it didn’t need to count M3. I suspect, the
numbers were just getting so big, it was too scary to continue to
publish. Up until they stopped publishing this figure, M3 ran roughly
one third more than M2. So, it is reasonable to assume that the
true money supply is at least one third more than what is officially
reported. Given rapid growth rates in the shadow banking sector,
off balance sheets and out of sight, the total money supply may be
considerably higher.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), shadow banks
have been doing over 50 percent of total lending by all banks. They
may be lending money they already have or they may be creating new money by their lending. They are in the shadows, so we do not know.
But shadow banking appears to be on a curve with an exponentially
growing rate of growth.<sup>40</sup> Shadow banking refers to the basic and
money creation activities of banks that deal in the creation and
exchange of shadow money. They are not required to report with the
same clarity of general banks, so the shadow also refers to the realm in
which they do business.

The Federal Reserve says in 1913, the banking system had $3.2 billion
in the money supply. In December of 2017, the Fed reported a
money supply of $13,918 billion – an average annual growth rate of
8.4 percent over 104 years. There have been some differences in the
way the money supply is counted over time, but these numbers are
likely reasonable approximations of M2. From 2016 to 2017 the total
M2 money supply increased by $625 billion.<sup>41</sup> <sup>42</sup> Adding another
third to this $14 trillion is roughly $18.5 trillion in the money supply.
Adding the shadow banking money creation adds an unknown
amount. Here’s another perspective to check our assumption that the
money supply is at least $18.5 trillion.

## Another perspective

Remember by assets, banks mean the IOUs (and a few real property
assets) that they have taken from the public in exchange for their
own IOUs (Federal Reserve Notes – our money). Bank assets should
be roughly equal to our money supply (less their equity). Does that
check out?

As of September 2017, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC)-insured banks held assets of $16.2 trillion<sup>43</sup> and the central
Fed another $4.5 trillion.<sup>44</sup> Most of those assets are IOUs from the
public or government for which the banks exchanged their own
IOUs (Federal Reserve notes) – a total of over $20 trillion in assets on
the books.

Roughly 11 percent of the banks’ booked assets are equity – things
they own outright, which may include real property, their own stock,
or stock in other companies.<sup>45</sup> The central Fed’s equity is roughly one
percent of their assets.<sup>46</sup> Subtract this equity from the $20.7 trillion

and you have another indicator of the size of the money supply –
about $18.4 trillion. The Fed reports the M2 money supply at $14
trillion.<sup>47</sup> Adding another third to $14 trillion is roughly $18.5 trillion.

Our supposition appears to hold. The total amount of money that
has been created by the private banking sector is at least $18.5 trillion.
If the IMF is correct, and shadow money is equal in amount to
M2, then the total money in the system may be close to $30 trillion.
Ignoring from one third to half the money supply is a recipe for bad
decisions.
