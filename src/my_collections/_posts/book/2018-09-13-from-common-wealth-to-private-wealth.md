The previous section considered how the wealth of individuals is
transferred to the wealthiest tiny percent. Let’s consider how publicly
owned wealth is transferred to private wealth of the wealthiest
Americans, too.

There are philosophical differences about whether there should be
publicly owned wealth. Some believe that only private individuals
take good care of property and therefore all property should be
in private hands. This is an offshoot of 20th century novelist, Ayn
Rand’s idolization of selfishness and the righteous pursuit of self-
interest.^170 Rand had an enormous impact on the thinking of 20th
century Libertarians and the GOP. Many in the GOP require their
staff to read her works.^171

There is no evidence to support this idolization of selfish interests.
Many individuals are wonderful stewards who take excellent, prudent
care of their land, with care for sustainability and their neighbors
well-being. But, unfortunately there are also many individuals who
exploit their property without regard for the impact on the larger
community.

Think of the giant redwoods that vanished – a glory lost for at least a
couple thousand years. Think of the decades when you couldn’t swim
in the Willamette river that runs through my city, Portland, Oregon.
Think of the tons of plastics in the oceans killing sea life and making
their way as microbeads into our food chain. Think of disappearing
fish populations. The evidence says that in the aggregate, individuals
are unwilling or unable to set aside personal, short-term needs and
greed, and act in the best interests of life as a whole system. This is
why whatever is crucial to the general welfare must be protected by
an effective government of, by and for the people.

## Selling off the commons

We sell off our common wealth at fire sale prices on good days and on
bad days.

### Selling off natural resources

On good days, we sell off many of our publicly owned natural
resources at minimal prices. For a pittance we allow wealthy
owners and lessees to extract oil, gas, and minerals permanently
depleting our common wealth, and often despoiling the land for
generations. Significant habitats are crisscrossed with industrial
infrastructure, with little obligation to protect and maintain a healthy
land. In the last few decades many states have improved decision-
making – gathering all stakeholders, and coming up with win-win
arrangements that preserve the value and sustainability of heritage
lands. In other states, there is room for improvement. It takes a
dedicated neutral facilitator-mediator, skill, and dedicated tax dollars.

For example, grazing rights are sold at such low prices, we’re giving
away these assets. The federal government charges $1.87 per animal
per month for grazing rights on federal lands.^172 The market rate for
state or privately owned land ranges from $8 to as high as $150.^173
Out of the meager haul in grazing fees, the federal Bureau of Land
Management is charged to,

_...ensure the long-term health and productivity of these lands and to create
multiple environmental benefits that result from healthy watersheds... administer
public lands ranching... provide livestock-based economic opportunities in
rural communities while contributing to... America’s social fabric and identity...
maintain open spaces in the fast-growing West, provide habitat for wildlife, offer
a myriad of recreational opportunities for public land users, and help preserve
the character of the rural West.^174_
```
Whew! This is a lot of work to do on a skimpy budget, and we end up
being poor stewards. If the going rate for renting land for grazing is
higher, why not charge the market rate and use the funds to improve our common wealth? Give discounts to lessees and extractors who
restore and improve the land, habitat and animal populations.
Republican President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act
of 1906 into law. This law established the first general legal protection
for cultural and natural resources. It gave us our National Parks and
Monuments. It required that land set aside as part of a monument
be “confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care
and management of the objects of historic or scientific interest to be
protected.” 175

Today, there is a clear difference in the political parties about the
meaning of “smallest area compatible” when it comes to protecting,
preserving, and exploiting our treasured wild lands. On a party
line vote in January 2016, Republicans eliminated a requirement to
consider the income and costs of public lands when considering their
sale.^176 This makes it easier to sell heritage assets to private interests –
one of the GOP’s stated platform goals.

In 2017, with full control of Congress and the Executive, the GOP is
moving quickly to sell off heritage assets. They are rapidly removing
the regulations that slow this process down, and which are intended
to assure that prudent and thoughtful choices are made for the future.
These cautionary exercises are considered, _“unnecessary impediments
and burdens, to expedite the offering of lands for lease.”_ 177

Eight months after taking office, Trump, by executive order, reduced
two national monuments – by 85 percent and 45 percent. Bears Ears
National Monument, was reduced by 1,150,860 acres. Nearby Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument was nearly cut in half.^178
Trump says there will be more reductions to come.

Now land in both former national monuments is on fast tract for sale
and resource extraction approval. Trump proclaimed that,

_At 9:00 a.m....the public lands excluded from the monument reservation shall be
open to: (1) entry, location, selection, sale, or other disposition under the public land laws and laws applicable to the U.S. Forest Service; (2) disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing; and (3) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws.179_

Trump’s proclamation makes it clear that the Republican
interpretation of the Antiquities Act’s requirement means bare
bones preservation and conservation with the following priorities:
transferring ownership to states and individuals, and resource
extraction by private business. Democrats, who established both of
these Monuments lean toward prudent and generous preservation for
future generations and the nation as a whole.^180

### Selling off property assets

On bad days, when money is tight, we are selling off public real
estate assets to fund current operations. For example, old schools
not currently being used are sold to private developers. This is short-
sighted. As populations grow, we will need these sites, and will then
need to buy something back at a much higher price to maintain the
community-based schools that are the heart of healthy communities.

### Selling off cultural resources

New technologies from taxpayer-funded research and development
benefit the private sector in a cultural variation of strip-mining. Prior
to 1980, new technologies developed with public funds belonged
to the common wealth. However, the _Bayh-Dole Act or Patent and
Trademark Law Amendments Act of 1980,_ changed our policy on
government funded research. Now the researcher and the research
institution have first dibs on owning and commercializing the
outcomes.

If taxpayers funded the research, taxpayers should share in the profit-
making. Or, better yet, why doesn’t the research remain in the public
domain where many can use it to launch new businesses? WE the
people paid for it. Why not make it open source and increase the
diversity of applications?

Open source would enhance our common wealth and prevent
unnecessary deaths. For example, the invention of the EpiPen was sponsored by the US Department of Defense in the 1970s. It is an
emergency antihistamine delivery system for people with asthma.
Though the invention was publicly funded it landed in the hands of
greedy profiteers who increased the price of this life-saving necessity
from $100 to $650 in 10 years – putting it out of the reach of many
and leaving people to die, or the public to pay many times over for
our own invention.^181

### Privatizing public services

Our money system’s wealth transfer machine is driving a privatization
of public functions, and limiting their use to people who can afford
to pay directly. Do you want to get to work in a timely way? On
some major highways we now have a lane for those who can afford
to pay a premium to drive in the fast lane, and clogged roads for the
rest of us.

We increasingly contract out public services to private contractors
and/or sell public assets to fund budget shortfalls. Thirty years ago
we publicly funded nearly all community services and considered
them our common wealth – fire departments, roads we travel, public
schools, prisons, the military. Today, a few wealthy people are buying
up our nation like crazy as we privatize and profitize public services.

Local and state governments struggle as devalued dollars and reduced
taxes on the wealthy and corporations cut their income. Since the
meltdown in 2008, governments have increased the sale of public
service income streams for short-term solvency. Private equity firms
like Blackstone, are buying up public services. Over 11 million
Americans now work for private-equity-backed businesses – roughly
7 percent of our employed workforce. Private equity companies now
own hospitals, ambulance, fire departments, and 911 services. They
own public water and utilities. The private equity companies are not
experienced managers; they follow a simple moneymaking playbook:
a mix of cost cuts, price increases, lobbying for de-regulation/lower
standards, and litigation.^182

In these life-critical service industries, cost cuts can mean increasing
risks, and this is proving true. Houses burn down because the for-profit fire department is understaffed and undertrained. People
die because there are too few ambulances or inadequate supplies,
or because ambulances break down from cost-cutting poor
maintenance.^183

Private contractors have a conflict of interest when it comes to
putting out fires, reducing prison populations, and making peace
in the world because it will put them out of business. Yet, for-profit
private contractors now make up 22 percent of the Department of
Defense’s workforce. They account for 50 percent of its _workforce cost._
The average contract employee costs two to three times as much as
the average civilian employee for performing similar work.^184 185

Taxpayers pay millions to train soldiers who fulfill a minimum service
requirement, and then move to the private sector where they will
pick up the same job with a government paid private contractor at a
higher wage. The private contractors get the benefits of our training
investment and a cost-plus profit for themselves. And, they have
a profit-motive for perpetuating war. This is the wealth transfer
machine and a black hole filler working together.

When the rich buy public services; they claim they will make them
more efficient, less costly, provide a better service AND make a profit
for themselves. There is little evidence this is possible. More often
than not, they eliminate well-paying jobs, eliminate pensions, hire
fewer and less qualified people at lower salaries, raise the cost and
extract their profits at service quality and taxpayer expense.

Many once public services, like fire protection, cannot be run for
efficiency. Wouldn’t we all prefer that we have enough fire fighters to
deal with a serious conflagration? And, if they end up spending their
days learning gourmet cooking and playing musical instruments or
cards, that’s fine. It means no fires! The same is true for ambulance
service. Don’t we want prompt life-saving service for everyone?

And, again privatization and profitization transfers wealth from
the middle class who once had well-paying jobs with pensions
to a very small elite of private owners skimming off a profit on
lower wages and mediocre services. Employees, now paid less and without pensions, shift from independent livelihoods to government
dependency and/or poverty.^186

It’s worth repeating: we guarantee our money with the health and
wealth of our commons. Degrade it. Sell it off to private owners.
Our guarantee will not hold, and our money system and society will
collapse. Our nation’s collapse is built into our current money system.
