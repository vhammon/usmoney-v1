An IOU can also be a promise of value that will be created and
produced in the future. It’s a subtle, but important difference when
it comes to money systems, and the common frame of commodity,
commodity-backed and fiat ignores this important difference.
Civilizations throughout time have monetized both kinds of IOUs –
receipt and promise.

**IOU _receipt_ money represents value that exists and is available
now. This IOU is for:**

...your stud ram I will board for you.

...10 bushels of wheat I will store for you in my silo.

...an ounce of gold I will store for you in my vault.

**IOU _future_ value money is a promise to produce value in the
future. This IOU is for:**

...one of my new lambs in the spring.

...10 bushels of wheat next fall.

...an ounce of gold I plan to have in my possession in the future.

...a credit on your taxes due.

...an hour of my service

The moment any of these IOUs for value to be produced in the future
begins circulating broadly in the community to be redeemed by
anyone, it becomes money.

## Two sides to an IOU

An IOU is a statement of relationship: one party is in debt, and the
other party has a credit. Some books about money focus on money
as debt and some focus on money as credit. In fact, there must be
a credit for every debt, and a debt for every credit. Curiously, how
people perceive money – as debt or as credit – affects their view of
IOU-future-value money. Issuing a credit conveys a position of power.
So, those who see this money as a credit often think well of credit-
money (as long as they like and trust those who have the power to
create it). Being in debt conveys a loss of power. Those who see this
money as a debt, often think poorly of this money system.

## Accounting and settlement

An IOU for future value needs a point of settlement or some form of
clearinghouse. If I have promised I will produce 10 bushels of wheat
next fall (my debt), and my promise of 10 bushels of wheat (a wheat
credit) is moving around in the community as money, then when
the wheat is gathered, someone must come and trade the IOU for
the wheat produced. If a banker promises to juggle investments and
pay you gold in the future (his debt), and the banker’s IOU is moving
around in the community as money (a gold credit), then there must
be some point in time and space for the banker to keep his promise
and hand over the gold. If I have earned 10 units of a community
currency by contributing 10 hours of service or 10 units worth of a
product to someone in my community, I must have somewhere to
spend it.

Think of the IOU as a hot potato. If the person holding the IOU in
the fall does not want 10 bushels of wheat or does not want to take
possession of the gold, now what? This issue of settlement has been
dealt with in three major ways.

### Government

Generally, governments are the biggest single spenders in an economy,
and they collect some form of taxes from everyone to make this spending possible. This makes government a good central settlement
point. A government can create IOU money that is a credit for
payment of future taxes. Tax credits are of value to anyone who must
pay taxes, and consequently to anyone doing business with those who
must pay taxes. This gives the tax credits nearly universal value.
Since the government is generally the largest consumer of goods
and services, it can spend these IOUs to pay for its expenses. These
government IOUs circulate in the society and eventually are used
to pay taxes, creating a continuous circulation loop and generating
economic activity.

The token of government-created tax-credit money can be in the
form of a coin – with or without a separate commodity value, or in
the form of a written note. The Chinese Song Dynasty (960–1269)
may have been the first to widely use paper credits. The Yuan Mongol
emperor, Kublai Khan (1260–1294) is credited with making paper
government notes the only legal currency under his reign. Marco
Polo reported on this use of money in his book, _The Travels of Marco
Polo_ , published in 1300. His report pollinated emerging western ideas
about money.<sup>5</sup>

Whether the token is made of clay, metal or paper, the concept is the
same: the token represents the credit side of an IOU for future value
(the payment of taxes), created by the state. The government is the
debtor in this relationship and the money is a credit good for future
payment of taxes.

### Private merchants and bankers

Private parties have stepped in to serve as clearing houses for IOUs for
future value.

Imagine if you, or I, or the small business on Main Street, need to
borrow to buy something now. Let’s say we write up an IOU that says
in 6 months the bearer of this IOU can come to us and we will give
them a gold coin or a quilt we have made of equal value. We get the
lumber store to accept this IOU for some wood we need to build a
quilt frame. More than likely, that is as far as our IOU will go. The lumberyard will not be able to use our IOU to pay for something
from someone else because we are not well enough known. Our IOU
does not have the authority, trustworthiness or prestige to make
it transferable in the community. Our IOU cannot become money
on its own.

However, a merchant-banker, person of great wealth or even apparent
wealth may be able to convince people he has the authority and
trustworthiness to make his IOUs good for use as money in the
community. He is able to create money out of nothing by issuing a
promise, because enough people believe his promises can and will be
fulfilled. (There is a reason why we associate banks with well-tailored
suits and imposing skyscrapers. Perception matters in the short term,
and wealth matters in the long run, when you are out to get a broad
community to accept your IOUs as money.)

When someone has reached this level of authority and
trustworthiness, when their IOUs are broadly accepted, transferred
from person to person, and used as money, they can do us a service.
You or I, or the small business on Main Street can go to this money-
creator-banker and offer them our IOU. They will verify our ability to
make good on our IOU, for which we will pay them fees and interest
on our borrowing. In exchange for our IOU, they will give us their
IOU, which is used as money in the community. New money is being
created for us to use by the private banker.

For the risk a borrower may default on a large loan, lenders
may require collateral worth a significant portion the loan. This
anchors our promise of future value in a present, available and
mortgaged asset.

The money-creator-banker is using their wealth and prestige to
convert our IOU into an IOU that serves as money in the community.
They are accepting a responsibility to keep all the IOUs trustworthy.
Based on a portfolio of promises from common people, the banker
issues its own future value IOUs, which become money. The banker’s
job is to be sure the terms of payment and payout allow the bank to
keep its promises. The banker charges interest on the loans he makes
that create new money for you and for the economy. He makes money on this juggling of future claims. **This is a significant step
beyond providing basic banking services, and characterizes nearly
all the private bankers in the world today.**

The rise of wealthy global merchant money-creator bankers in the late
middle ages provided a valuable service and accelerated activity in the
global marketplace. These banks functioned as IOU intermediaries,
turning the promises of local farmers and producers into a global
trading currency. This gave these merchant bankers a power in the
global marketplace that transcended national laws and boundaries.
It gave them the power to challenge the divine right and previously
unquestionable authority of monarchs, who had been monopolizing
the power to create new money. This private sector power helped
fuel the shift from despotic to democratic rule over the following
centuries. The shift away from the divine rights of monarchs moved
in practice to the divine rights of wealth and capital. It is unclear
where the divine rights will go next. I hope we will recognize the
value of a genuine government of, by and for the people, and put it
into effective practice.

### Mutual credit money systems

Cooperatively governed associations have stepped in to serve as
clearing houses for IOUs for future value. A democratically elected
governing board reviews and accepts IOUs for future value from
a member, often requiring assets for collateral. In exchange, they
create new money for the member to use within the exchange. The
association’s future-value IOUs are the money supply.

In a mutual credit money system, the trustworthiness of the
participants is critical because there may not be any guarantee for
the value of the currency, such as a government or commonwealth
backing it up. The strength of the currency is supported by the
integrity and productivity of the participants. For this reason, they
function best when the record and accounting is open and the
trustworthiness of participants is widely known. Mutual credit money
systems make excellent complementary systems, providing backup
when primary currencies are experiencing difficulty. The Swiss WIR
mention in [Chapter 3.21](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-3/section-21) is an example of such a system. Whether a mutual credit money system could function on a very broad, national
or global level has yet to be tested. New computer technologies may
offer a way to establish trustworthiness and authority [(Chapter 4.39).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-4/section-39)

## The value of borrowing

An IOU for future earnings or services gets some of its trustworthiness
from the fact that with adequate investment, we really can create
greater value. If I have just one loom, I can only make so much
fabric. It may take me decades to save enough to buy a second loom
and increase my production. If I can borrow to buy a second loom
now, I can immediately increase my production, pay off the second
loom, and increase my profits. This is the value of debt-credit: having
money to spend now, based on a promise to create value and return
the loan in the future.

Historically, when it has been easy to borrow, and when the borrowed
money has been invested in research, development and capital
improvements, we have seen increases in innovation and production.
For example, at the end of the 19th century, borrowed money was
readily available. The nation was heading up the steep slope of the
money expansion cycle curve – which would collapse with the Great
Depression in 1929. The railroads, which were the boom industry
of the times, introduced specialized departments for research and
development (R&D). They invested in new product and service
development. This concept of R&D departments became widespread
and contributed to the bloom of innovation in the 20th century.

However, keep in mind that this borrowing advantage holds true in
any money system. Loans can come from existing money savings or
can serve to create new money in an IOU-future-value money system.
How loans are issued in relation to the creation of money is a system
choice. In other words: **making a loan does not always create
new money, but in an IOU-future-value money system, all new
money is created by making a loan** (a promise of future value to be
delivered).

## The issuer makes a difference

Does it make a difference whether a formal government, private
bankers or a defined local or community of affinity creates the
IOU-future-value money? Yes. A government or self-governing
community can choose a stable, fixed value money. Private for-profit
banker-money creators have never been known to do so, and by
definition their for-profit business model may exclude a stable and
fixed value money.

### Government

Governments can be for-profit or not-for-profit institutions. Despots,
dictators, monarchs, and nearly all forms of rule by a privileged elite
have generally governed as if they were profit-taking institutions.
These privileged elites have lived in great luxury, building up hefty
bank accounts by skimming off the national treasury and economy.
This constant skimming off the top requires an ever-increasing supply
of money to satisfy their greed, and satisfy the need for money in the
general economy. An increasing supply of money results in a steadily
decreasing value money system.

However, democratically elected governments, _functioning as effective
and true democracies_ can make wise choices and do their best to
determine the right amount of money for a nation, state, bioregion or
local community; they can do their best to keep the value of money
stable and function as a non-profit institution working for society
as a whole. That is a choice they can make. (It’s a struggle to get rid
of cronyism and corruption, though. And, the choice of a money
creation system has a determining impact on whether effective and
truly democratic governance is even possible – a difficult, vicious
circle to break.)

### Private business

Private business is by definition a profit-making enterprise. It works
to make a profit, to grow and expand its market share. Up until
recently in US law a business with shareholders – a C-Corporation - had to make profit-taking for its shareholders its highest value
    and overriding goal. And, to date, all our major banks are C-Corps.
Beginning around 2006, the B-Corp movement successfully made
it legal for corporations to add social responsibility to their mandate.
But, to date, no major banks have changed their corporate status.
Making profits on business activity is a good thing; it drives
hard work and innovation, and can certainly be done without
compromising the common wealth or the common good – when we
set that value and corresponding goal.

However, there is an important difference between making profits
on doing business and making profits on the privilege of creating the
money that will be used by all businesses. The privilege of creating
new money is an advantage accorded no other business. Yet as a
private C-Corp business, a bank must do its best to make a profit on
its money creation. The bank will juggle the incoming repayments
and outgoing promises with the intent of never being caught short –
all while maximizing profits. It will charge fees, collect interest, and
issue as many promises as it feels it can manage. It will make profits
on its business enterprises and on every bit of money it creates. As
a profit-making business it will do everything it can to expand its
money-creation activities, whether or not that benefits the common
good and general welfare. By definition and by law, a private business
cannot serve the nation as a whole in its money creation, it must
serve its own interests.

## An IOU-future-value money system

### Who Decides

Again, any kind of community government can decide to use an
IOU-future-value money system. This decision may happen by the
decree of a dictator or by the consensual agreement of community
members. When an IOU for future-value is used broadly by a
community as a medium of exchange, it has become monetized.

### Authentic & Trustworthy

An IOU-future-value money gets its trustworthiness from the
reputation of the person or entity making the promise to come up
with value in the future. For a whole community to accept an IOU
for producing future value as trustworthy, the issuer of the IOU has
generally needed to be someone of great wealth and/or political
power. It is impossible to get community wide confidence your
Uncle Ernie will keep his promise. But kings, merchant-bankers,
governments, and community networks with good reputations, or
with armed or market force to demand their IOUs be accepted, can
turn their future value IOUs into money. In rare instances, an open,
full disclosure cooperative community has successfully maintained
authority and trustworthiness for its money.

#### INHERENT RISK

Creating an IOU for the production of some future value is in a sense
creating money out of thin air. The promises may be guaranteed by
wealth and an ability to manage credits and promises successfully.
However, a promise to produce value in the future is inherently risky.
Life happens. Banks and governments may make promises about
the future, but they cannot prevent natural and man-made disasters.
And monarchs, great merchant-bankers and ruling elites have a well-
deserved reputation for making too many promises they cannot keep.
IOU-future-value money is risky. In just the past 40 years, we had
the 1987 market crash, 1989 junk bond crash, 1994 Mexico-US crash,
1997–98 Asia crisis, 1999–2000 Dotcom bubble, and the 2007–2008
global financial crisis.

#### TRUST IN GOD, BUT TIE UP YOUR CAMEL

People and their governments have demanded a form of IOU-future-
value money with a partial collateral guarantee. Whoever is issuing
IOUs for future value must set aside a proportional value of real assets
to back up their promises. This might mean their promises had to be
guaranteed by land they owned, or property, or precious metals, or
other assets that could be converted in the marketplace, should they
over promise. The most common form of this partially collateralized
IOU-future value money is called fractional reserve [(See Chapter
4.32).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-4/section-32) Collateralizing strategies shift the money system to a hybrid of
commodity-backed and future value money.

Note: this form of guarantee was not a product of a _free_ market.
Markets have shown no inclination to tie up assets in the interest of
the general welfare or the stability of a monetary system. Markets
tend toward whatever minimal guarantees they can get away with
while maximizing personal profits in the short-term. Free market
advocates want you to accept on faith that if everyone pursues their
short-term selfish interests, magically, the marketplace will be most
efficient and money will flow to its best and highest uses. There is
absolutely no evidence this is true, but it is a matter of faith for many.

### Creation & Destruction

IOU-future-value money is created when a promise is made. Anyone
can make a promise to produce value in the future and to convey
it to others upon their demand. However, to become money, this
promise must be transferable to other people, and must be considered
valuable by enough people to make its use widespread. Again,
historically, that has limited this kind of money to the promises of
governments and people of great wealth and power – the bankers or
global merchants. A government decree has often been made to turn
these IOUs into community-wide money. Nearly every single unit
of money in circulation today was created by private bankers, given
authority and guarantees by their national governments.

IOU-future-value money is extinguished when the promise is fulfilled
and the IOU exchanged for whatever value was promised. Between
creation and destruction, this IOU money can circulate for any length
of time in the marketplace. For example, let’s say a farmer issues a
wheat credit – an IOU for 10 bushels of wheat. The wheat credit may
circulate for any amount of time, buying and selling many times the
value of the 10 bushels of wheat. But, when someone takes the IOU
to the farmer and exchanges it for 10 bushels of wheat, the IOU is
marked paid, and its use as money is over. However, the farmer may turn right around and create a new wheat credit that will keep the
supply of money even.

The same principle applies when a bank issues an IOU to produce
a certain amount of gold in the future, and those bank promises
are in use as money. This IOU-gold certificate, in use as money, may
circulate for any length of time. But, when someone takes it to the
bank and exchanges it for the gold, the IOU is marked paid, and that
IOU-gold certificate is no longer part of the money supply. However,
it is difficult to make counterfeit-proof IOU money, especially when
the money token is a piece of paper. So, instead of tearing up or
destroying the note (e.g. cash bills), when the promise is fulfilled,
IOU-future value money tokens are generally re-used by the bank to
make another promise, and the note swings back into circulation as
part of the money supply. If the bank’s IOU is an accounting entry,
then that particular issuance of money, vanishes with the stroke
of a key.

### Measure of Value

An IOU-future value money system can be an elastic measure or fixed
measure system, depending on how and who creates the new money.
Nearly all current systems that give the privilege of creating money
to the private banks, are elastic measure systems with an expanding
supply and shrinking value.

### Store of Value

An IOU for future earnings is a conditional promise: if there are no
natural disasters, manmade catastrophes, wars, or famines; if the
person making the promises continues to be healthy and powerful; if
the banks making the promises are prudent and wise; if the national
economy remains healthy and productive, then the promises will be
kept. So, money that is an IOU for value produced in the future, may
or may not maintain its value. The value of IOU future value money
will reflect the confidence of its users in the ability of the issuer to
keep their promises.

### who rules?

There are significant differences between the various IOU-future value
money systems; but the main differences lie in a society’s choice of
values, which determines who wields the power to create new money
for everyone. As we know, whoever gets to create new money, will be
in power.
