A healthy ferment around money systems exists on the edges
of society and in small communities. People unhappy with the
outcomes of the prevailing money system seek better options.
Currencies that are complements, supplements or alternatives to the
national money have often helped communities get through difficult
periods when the national currency collapsed. They serve to provide
backup economic resilience; they connect unused production with
unmet needs.

As we increasingly live in an economy that makes money scarce for
a growing majority of people, there is considerable thought about
ways to strengthen local economic activity. Hundreds of different
complementary currency systems are in use today as healthy adjuncts
to national and global money.

## Specific community money

Many complementary money systems limit their use to a specific
geographic or commerce community. This limitation is intended to
keep value produced by the community in the community. More
often than not, their value is pegged to the national currency. For
example, cities have special currencies that encourage people to
spend locally. In the US, Ithaca New York had one of the earliest
community currencies, introduced in 1991. It was the inspiration for
local currencies in dozens of other US cities. Several million dollars
in exchanges were made using this money. But, when the founder
left town and the global use of digital transactions pushed out most
cash, the currency floundered. By 2011, there were very few businesses
still accepting the currency. In 2015 another Ithaca group launched a
digital local currency, which is still in startup. The rest of these local
currencies show a wide range of failure and success.<sup>26</sup>

As first described in [Chapter 3.21,](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-3/section-21) the Swiss have a complementary
currency called the WIR. It is credited with stabilizing their economy
over the past 80 years, enabling it to weather global financial storms
better than most other nations. The Swiss WIR is pegged to the Swiss national money, but it is not convertible into any other currency,
and so limits exchanges to the participants. It was created to address
a global financial crisis in the 1930s. Though the banks fought this
complementary money system, they lost the fight. Today, roughly
16 percent of Swiss businesses belong, and the annual volume of trade
in the WIR is almost $2 billion. While this is a small percentage of
a $470 billion GDP, the use of this complementary currency goes
up when there are downturns in the traditional money marketplace,
and goes down when the traditional marketplace is humming along.
Over the past couple hundred years an average of 10 countries
every year experience a monetary crisis, so it is a great boon to have
resilience against the drifting global monetary dis-ease. The WIR
functions as a dual currency that protects the Swiss from global
economic downturns, and accounts for their strong GDP and
resilience. Resilience is a product of backup and supplementary or
complementary systems.<sup>27</sup>

## Time or service bank

In the realm of alternatives to a traditional money system, there are
endless ways people can use time or service to buy other goods or
services. These systems, while called _currencies,_ are closer to barter
banks than money systems. However, they successfully match
unmet needs with unused time or production and they are a worthy
supplement to a primary money system.

Airline miles are a good example. Airlines use mileage programs to
fill unused space, promote full capacity and higher profits. They also
serve as a way to give loyal customers the equivalent of a discount
on their travel. Some airlines allow people to use their mileage to
purchase items in an airline store.

There are countless other examples of products or services that are
banked and then spent – caregiving, legal services, tutoring, etc. For
example, as people live longer, there is an increasing need for elder
care. Under our current money system there is not enough money
to pay for the necessary elder care. The Japanese have an eldercare
program, called caring relationship tickets, or _fureai kippu_ , in which anyone can care for the elderly in their neighborhood and bank their
hours of service. One can transfer these credits to someone else, or
bank them for one’s personal use when one gets old. Established in
1995, this successful program is serving as a model.<sup>28</sup>

Schools have experimented with banks for tutoring services provided
by students. Tutoring units can either be used to purchase tutoring
for themselves, or they can use their savings to pay state college
tuition. Everyone benefits – the kids who tutor learn better because
teaching is the best way to remember; the kids who are tutored learn
more and develop cooperative relationships within a school; the
school saves money; the teachers are less stressed and do a better job
with all their students; and the college tuition forfeited eventually is
tiny in relation to the overall benefits.

Some departments of justice have a mutual-credit arrangement with
immigrants who cannot afford legal services. The immigrant commits
to provide units of translation service to the court in exchange for
the number of units of legal service they receive. In Curitiba, Brazil,
people collect garbage from tiny streets inaccessible to trucks, and
trade the garbage for bus tokens.

By definition, these are not money systems; there is no token used
broadly across a community for a variety of exchanges. But, in a
limited sense, they are supplementary currencies, and they are clever
ways to match unmet needs with unused production or service.
For a fascinating look at the extraordinarily creative mutual-credit/
debt money systems, including those above, read Bernard Lietaer
and Jacqui Dunne’s excellent book, _Rethinking Money; How New
Currencies Turn Scarcity into Prosperity_ (2013).<sup>29</sup> Creating a resilient
economy is important, and complementary and supplementary
currency systems are a critical component of the diversity needed for
resilience.

### Who Decides

In general, complementary money systems are cooperative currencies
with egalitarian decision-making. A governing agreement is required
that designates a limited community in which this currency will function, establishes a unit of value, a system of authority and
trustworthiness, and a means of maintaining a community-wide set
of individual accounts.

The decision is most often made by a group of interested businesses
and/or individuals. A local government can agree to accept this
currency for public services, though in the US this runs into
conflict with legal tender laws. Community wide agreement is
another sticking point. Local currencies often successfully gain a
small core of committed participants, but because the currency can
only be used within a local circle, it is deemed inferior to a money
that can circulate more broadly – especially in our global and
internet economy.

That said, because the decision-making is often cooperative, and the
systems themselves often encourage cooperative and collaborative
economic activity which strengthens community bonds, these
complementary systems support healthier communities.

### Token

The money token is generally either a simple record on paper or
on computer. Many communities have paper tokens designated to
represent a certain value – often hours of work.

### Authentic & Trustworthy

Supplementary systems function best when they are open
information systems; information about participants’ trustworthiness
is fully available to all. This is also one of their limitations. These
systems can function well within a clearly defined membership
community. But, in today’s world, a widely used currency – used
amongst strangers, including criminal elements – must have resources
to block counterfeiting and hackers. This is where some community
hours efforts get stuck. Authentication and trustworthiness is
challenging and expensive; counterfeiters and hackers abound. New
blockchain computer technology, addressed in the next section, may
resolve this issue and make local and alternative adjunct money
systems more practical.

### Measure & Store of Value

The value of any currency evolves at it is used; its value is an aggregate
of its value in the exchanges made over time by a whole community.
An established currency may have centuries of data processed
by multitudes into a general community idea of its value. A new
community currency must begin somewhere with a value. Some use
an hour of work as their measure, but this runs into issues about
whose hour of work is setting the standard – a minimum wage hour?
–a professional hour? Generally, community money systems, use the
legal tender money as at least the initial standard of measuring value.

Some community money systems are designed to be stable and
maintain a constant money value. Some community systems have
been designed to steadily devalue the currency to encourage people to
use it and not hoard it.

### Creation

Complementary money systems create money in several different
ways. Sometimes, people use the national currency to buy into the
program, pegging their money unit to a set value of the national
currency. Some local community money systems use the national
currency to buy and sell the local currency at a discounted rate,
encouraging people to prefer the use of the local currency. This
purchase of local currency with national currency brings the local
currency into use, but it is not really creating new money, it is
converting the established money – which is created however it is
created – into a local use money. Some community currencies allow
people to exchange their community currency back into the primary
currency; some do not. Some community money systems give
participants a certain number of startup units. For their participation
to continue, they must buy and sell using the money units.

Some complementary money systems are IOU-future value money
systems that create money in an initial exchange. These are called
_mutual-credit currencies,_ because the money is created in a mutually
agreed upon trade between two participants. This is a system in which having a negative balance is not a bad thing. It is necessary to
get the ball rolling. Participants are generally expected to maintain a
positive balance most of the time, though an option to run a negative
balance within the community for short stretches can make this a
healthy complementary system during economic downturns.

### Destruction

Most of these complementary currencies cease to be when they
go unused.

## Ultimately, who rules?

Complementary currencies have been established in recognition
of the way today’s primary money systems extract money from
communities and pass it up to a tiny elite who rarely reside in the
community, and/or who spend the bulk of their money elsewhere.
They are an effort to keep some money recirculating within the
community. Because they are localized efforts that in general, still
rely on the measurement, exchange and storage capabilities of the
national currencies, they do not change who rules in a significant way.
But, they offer pools of cooperation and healthy community in what
today is an otherwise desert of greed and profit-taking at the expense
of our well-being.
