_There is something curious in the movements of this modern complicated
machine, the funding system; and it is only now that it is beginning to unfold
the full extent of its movements. In the first part of its movements it gives
great powers into the hands of government, and in the last part it takes them
completely away._\
— Thomas Paine, 1796^1

In America, money creation has been an issue of contention since
Europeans settled on the North American continent. It was one of
the major issues that caused the Revolution and the establishment of
the United States. It was one of the primary causes of the Civil War.^2
Underlying the controversy are beliefs about two fundamentals: who
should govern and what is money.

## Who should rule?

Some believe a few elites should rule – and wealth is a good indicator
of who is deserving of power. People who are rich are considered
by some to be better and smarter and therefore deserve the power
to rule over the rest of us. This point of view is often promoted by
those of great wealth. It is supported by those who tend toward an
authoritarian view of the world – a world where one is either a leader
or follower, and strong authoritarian rule is considered the natural
order and desirable.

Others believe humans are created equal under the law and everyone
should be able to participate in decision-making that affects their
lives. This is a mutual respect, collaborative or partnership model of
human society.

These opposing views have been in a tug-of-war perhaps since time
began. As Riane Eisler so deftly posits in _The Chalice and the Blade:
Our History Our Future_ (1988),^3 we have been moving back and forth between partnership and dominator models of society for millennia.
Since the power of money creation bestows the power to rule, one’s
belief in who should rule will determine who should get to create
money for a society.

## Evolving ideology and technology

Our decision-making and governing strategies are evolving. We
know more today about how the best decisions are made than we
did before. However, we are very slow to implement what we know.
In part, this is because the political right has strongly promoted the
idea that all government is bad. And, while one might think the idea
that we must have a government and make decisions together goes
without saying, it doesn’t. As Republican strategist, Grover Norquist
crowed in 2001 when the Bush II administration successfully cut
taxes on the wealthy, _“I don’t want to abolish government. I simply
want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom
and drown it in the bathtub.”_ 4 This is a common sentiment now in
America; belief in government per se is at a low ebb.

So, I’m saying it: every land has laws made using some form of
government. People live in societies, and societies establish behavior
standards, a way to hold people to those standards, and a way to
resolve inevitable conflicts. Living in society means following its
rules or accepting the consequences. Some societies do better than
others at engaging everyone in issue-based rule-making and problem
solving, that genuinely resolves conflicts, instead of creating new ones.
But that is about quality of governance, not about whether societies
are governed. The quality of governance is evolving and money
plays a role.

### The divine rights of monarchs

Up until the last few hundred years, most laws were made by
powerful rulers who issued declarations as they saw fit. A monarch
could declare, _“Let it be done!”_ and it was. The right to declare and
issue money was an important buttress for the general powers of
monarchs.

We once believed the best decisions were made by special people –
often with an inherited right to rule, considered by their birth to be
chosen by divine right. Even when they were the strongest or meanest
or richest, there was a tendency to think that if they were in authority,
they were supposed to be there. Nearly all large scale governments for
the first few thousand years of recorded history used this model. If we
compare an individual to a community, this was society’s childhood.
In childhood we are first unconsciously, then consciously dependent
on authority, and consequently in awe of it. So, in society’s
childhood, rulers are held in awe and dependence on their whim is
considered natural.

### The emergence of human rights

In the age of the early empires, the creation of money for the realm
was the right of the ruler, and an important source of wealth and
power. About 800 years ago, as global trade increased, a merchant
class developed their own system of accounting and settlement that
functioned as a private money system. This encouraged a shift away
from the idea of a single divinely sanctioned ruler because it gave an
independent and overriding power to the private financial sector. The
power to issue money shifted from a few individuals and their inner
circle with hereditary, ruling power to a few wealthy individuals and
their inner circle with power in the global marketplace.

Concurrently, the idea that individual rulers could make a mess
of things gained traction; we began to believe that a broader based
decision-making and power structure might be a better choice. The
evolution of money played a role in making the shift from the divine
right of monarchs to the rule of law and republics with broader
based governing structures. The concept of human rights blossomed.
Perhaps these centuries have been society’s adolescence.

An adolescent tends to see the world in terms of being dependent
or being independent. The drive to become an independent adult is
strong and the cry for freedom from authority is loud. However, it is
common for adolescents to simply switch their authority figure from
parent to the alpha dog in their peer group; it takes a healthy growing up process for children to truly become conscious, independent
individuals, able to recognize and function in an _interdependent_ world.
And not everyone makes it to this level of maturity.

### Still evolving

Can we say that there is a parallel with governance? We the people are
conscious of the historical tradition of dependence on a government
that reflects the opinions and views of a tiny elite group of people.
We have struggled to be independent of kings and the whims of
despots, but still have family power dynasties and give greater voice
to those with extreme wealth. There has been a lot of dysfunction
in our growing up, and too many of us have shifted allegiance to
the authority of capital – the authority of those who have the most
money. We have been comfortable putting blind faith and trust
in the integrity and authority of the bankers, financiers and the
marketplace. I recommend the book, _The Divine Right of Capital_ by
Marjorie Kelly (2001) for an exposition of this state of affairs.^5

Individually and collectively, we are still evolving. We are learning
to recognize our interdependence and to step into the responsibility
of genuine self-governance. This means balancing freedoms with
responsibilities. If your politician is talking about freedom and liberty,
ask that they give equal time to individual and civic responsibility for
the general welfare. Choosing a money system that supports genuine
self-governance will be a step toward achieving this balance.

## Defining money

### Is money a commodity or a social technology?

Defining money as a commodity that can be stored as wealth
benefits the wealthy, and a dominator model of society. This is the
particle theory of money ([Chapter 3.16).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-3/section-16) Defining money as a social
technology supports a partnership model of society. This is the wave
model of money. How we define money has been debated since well
before the founding of our nation.

### Colonial Currencies and the British Crown

The early European settlers in America did not have any money of
their own. They brought the money of European countries with
them. It wasn’t enough. People bartered and exchanges were made
as accounts with a general store. These accounts were sometimes
settled with the fruits of one’s own labor, or using Native American
wampum for a while, as well as a variety of experiments in local
commodities, coin and currency. Colonists soon recognized the need
for their own money.

America became a great monetary laboratory, experimenting with
various kinds of money, such as agricultural commodities (Maryland
and Virginia, 1632–1692); gold and silver coins (Massachusetts, 1652–
1685); land banks (South Carolina, Massachusetts, 1675–1740s); true
common wealth money spent into circulation (Massachusetts, 1690–
1714); and common wealth money lent into circulation (Pennsylvania,
1723–1726). For a comprehensive review of the history of money,
read The Lost Science of Money by Stephen Zarlenga (2002). It is rich
in stories for the history buff and provides an in-depth look at the
historical basis for our concepts of money.^6

The wealthy banking interests consistently promoted the idea that
_true_ money was gold or silver because it was a commodity and real,
meaning tangible. At the same time, most meant fractional gold
reserve money. Some described their bills of credit as a derivative of
real money, not to be considered as money, however much they were
used as such. When inevitable bubbles and busts occurred because
of the issuance of privately issued, fractional-reserve IOU-future-value
money (a.k.a _bills of credit_ ), they consistently promoted the story that
the problems were with government or with any central control over
their money creation.

By the 1600s the private British banking interests had control of
Britain’s monetary system. They pressured the crown into refusing to
allow the colonists to create their own money. In the 1600s and 1700s
this pressure waxed and waned as the colonists defied the British and
experimented. In the late 1700s the pressure grew relentless. This
meant a shortage of money, difficulty doing business, and extreme
hardship – a major reason for revolution.

### Articles of Confederation

When the colonies joined together to revolt and establish their own
government, a uniform and stable money was of primary concern.
The Articles of Confederation gave the federal government the power
to _emit bills of credit_ that would be used as legal tender for paying
taxes and for all exchanges. During the course of the Revolutionary
War, our Congress authorized the printing of $200 million in legal
tender, calling them _Continentals._ Though called, _bills of credit,_ these
were pure commonwealth money; they were not promises to pay later,
or promises to pay some quantity of gold or silver. They were backed
by the commitment of our young nation.

From the point of view of the global money interests – home based
in England and Scotland at that time – the creation of a sovereign
or commonwealth currency was a dire threat to their global control
of commerce. The British ship, the _HMS Phoenix,_ sat off New York’s
shore with printing presses on board turning out counterfeit $
bills to flood the fledgling and war torn economy. When the British
General Howe took New York in 1776, the printing presses moved
into town, cranking out untold numbers of counterfeit notes. The
British ran ads in the paper asking for people willing to carry the false
currency into areas held by the rebellion. They succeeded in crashing
the value of the Continental, but it took them all six years of the
Revolutionary War to do it.^7

The Continentals got us through our war of Independence, but the
counterfeiting and follow-up propaganda of the money powers
convinced many that the money collapsed because it was issued by
government, instead of private interests. They used the false idea
that private bankers’ money was fully backed by gold or silver and
therefore the only true money.

### Confusion

At the time our Constitution was written there were confused and
confusing arguments about the best money for our nation. Some
founders believed that money was a commodity and should be
outside the purview of government. Some founders fully understood
the role of money creation and wanted that power to belong
to government. Other founders, mostly bankers and financiers
themselves, argued for the power to rest in their hands.

For example, Alexander Hamilton became the Secretary of the
Treasury in 1790 and played a significant role in shifting the power
to create money from the government to the private bankers by
promoting the _United States Bank Act of 1791._ He then became a
founding member-owner of the bank.^8

Some argued about whether money should be created at the
state or federal level by private interests or by government. Some
misunderstood the role of a central bank (in service to its members)
and saw a central bank as an issue of state vs. federal authority, and
made their arguments accordingly.

Another argument was about the nature of money. Some argued only
gold and silver could be money, effectively ignoring the fact that gold
and silver were generally only a standard and reserve, not the bulk of
the money in circulation.

**So, what arguments won out? What does our Constitution say
about money creation?**
