In a privately run reserve money creation system, the pressure to
expand the money supply is like the force of water carving out a
canyon. Overtime, the canyon gets deeper and wider. First, the
reserve requirements are whittled away to almost nothing. When
reserve requirements have effectively been eliminated, even bankers
are willing to admit it might be prudent to have some standard
limiting how much new money the banks create.

## Capital ratio requirements

As reserve requirements have been phased out, governments have
instituted requirements that banks have a net worth, also known as
equity or capital, that is a specified ratio to their assets. This ratio
of equity to assets is called _leverage,_ because the banks are using
what they own (equity) as the basis for speculative juggling of their
own IOUs (liabilities) with the IOUs of others to them (assets). The
global banking leverage ratio has run in the 2–8 percent range for
decades. This means when a bank creates new money by lending
out $100, it must have $2–$8 of its own money on hand to cover
losses. For example, if too many of the people to whom they have
issued mortgages default, or too many of their speculative bets prove
bad, and the value of their net equity drops more than the required
2–8 percent, they are broke – insolvent.

By 2007, the bankers were generally operating at 2–3 percent equity.
It wasn’t enough. The drops in the value of banks’ assets after the
2007 market crash were well into the double digits and the banks
were insolvent. They needed that $16.1 trillion in revolving credit
from the central bank to stay afloat ([Chapter 3.23](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-3/section-23) and [Chapter 5.53](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-5/section-53)).

After the 2008 meltdown, a global, voluntary regulatory framework
for bankers, headquartered at the Bank of International Settlements
in Switzerland, signed on to what is called the _Basel III Accord_. This
accord established a voluntary set of standards requiring 8 percent in equity capital as a percentage of all of a bank’s assets. The
requirements were to be implemented beginning in 2013. But, under
pressure from the banks, full implementation has been postponed
until 2019.<sup>14</sup> The Basel III Accord is a recommendation, and it is
being made law using different accounting standards in different
countries.

At 2–8 percent equity, bankers do not have much skin in the game.
Unlike a reserve requirement, a capital requirement does not demand
the bank set aside a certain value and keep it out of the action.

An asset can be earning new revenue for them and count as equity.
The banks are required to keep enough of what are considered
low-risk assets to serve as this equity anchor. However, as with reserve
requirements, the banks work hard to minimize any loss of profit. In
this endeavor, they have had a great deal of control over how their
assets should be counted in these calculations. Their manipulation
of governments and laws has rendered capital requirements nearly as
meaningless as reserve requirements.

## Measuring the value of assets

What banks own and count as their equity-capital may consist of
precious metals, commodities, property, or claims to any to these.
Equity may also consist of high value IOUs such as government bonds,
or the IOU promises from institutions with a high rating. Most banks’
assets are other people’s IOUs of one kind or another.

Some IOU promises are more likely to be kept than others. Your high-
risk-taking Uncle Ernie is not as secure a bet as Uncle Sam – the US
government. And, broad economic conditions can negatively impact
even the most responsible of borrowers. Since an IOU is vulnerable
to default, and properties pledged are vulnerable to destruction or
devaluation, governments require banks to risk-weight the value of
their assets.

However, banks have convinced most governments they should be
allowed to create their own formulas to determine how to weight
their bets when calculating their reportable assets. Banks and governments have established elaborate systems and standards for risk-weighting assets. Unfortunately, the more elaborate the standards,
the more likely it is that bankers find ways to game them. And, that
is what happens.

It is clear it is NOT easy for banks to see where hazards may lie, and
pretty foolish to allow them to create their own formulas for risk-
weighting their own assets, when they put the entire economy in
jeopardy with their decisions in our current system.

## Anchor assets-Government IOUs

In the US, and to a lesser and lessening extent abroad, US
Government debt is considered the best bet of all and is expected to
anchor a bank’s other bets with a degree of certain return. According
to the International Monetary Fund, US dollars make up 63 percent
of the foreign exchange reserves held by global banks.<sup>15</sup> In the United
States, banks count US government debt as sound as cash or gold.
So, under our current system, government debt has a key role in
the purported stability of the system. Because US government debt
fills this anchor role, there must be enough of it to anchor the new
money created by the private banking sector. The more money the
private bankers create, the more US government debt there must be
to count towards the stability and security of their choices. A graph of
government debt roughly follows the same exponential curve as the
total money supply created by the private bankers.

Hence, it makes no sense to talk about reducing government
overspending and debt when the money system in place **requires
government debt keep up with the money creation of the
private bankers.**

### Politicians with a poor understanding

ANY politician who says the government should keep within its
budget, just as individuals should, does not understand our monetary
system. And, that is dangerous. Politicians who believe this will be
easy to manipulate and will make poor decisions, since their decisions
will NOT be grounded in an understanding of our money system.
