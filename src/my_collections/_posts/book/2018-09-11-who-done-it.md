I love a good murder mystery. So, as I read the paper and watch the
news, I wonder, what is poisoning and crippling our nation? Will
the culprits be caught and held accountable? Can we be healthy and
prosperous?

I read reports of bad behavior that corrupts our politics and our
economy, and grind my teeth. But in better moments, I’m less
interested in culprits and more interested in how the systems we
create for living determine the boundaries and priorities in our
lives. Improvements at the system level have a real impact. Blaming
individuals, the media, bankers, the rich, the poor, unions, business,
nonprofits, liberals or conservatives just doesn’t help much.

At first I thought the problem was our failure to have clear and honest
financial reports from our government. As a nation we tax and spend,
but if we do not understand how much money we have or where it
has to go, we make poor choices. And very few of us understand the
financial reports of the US government. Most people do not even
know these reports are readily available every year; it hardly makes
the news when they are issued in mid-December.

It seemed like time for America to sit down at our metaphorical
kitchen table and go over what we have to spend, what our priorities
are, and how to spend what we have. So, I invested several years
deciphering the US federal government’s financial reports, and
came up with a simple, clear and useful way to improve them. The
changes I recommend are described in my book, _On the Path to Great
Democracy; Clear and Honest Financial Reports_ (2007).

On my way out the door to promote that book, however, I became
convinced the real problem lay deeper. The failure to pay attention
to the US Financial Report is a symptom of a system that, by design,
creates confusion and delusion: the monetary system itself.

I then set out to read everything I could find on our money and
banking systems. This book is the result. After 10 years of intensive study, I’ve concluded the money system is THE most important
structural component of a community. It sets the boundaries of
commerce, determines who gets rich and stays rich, who becomes
poor and stays poor. It determines whether privilege or hard work
reigns. It determines whether we work toward a _“more perfect Union”_
or toward extraordinary wealth disparity. Because a money system
is a matter of choice, as we shall see, it is a practical reflection of
our values.

When we don’t understand the money system, without knowing we
don’t, most of us end up in a dark sea swimming into the jaws of
sharks, like tuna blithely hoping for the best. We end up arguing
back and forth about the best way to keep the financial sharks well
fed and the rest of us out of harm’s way – a hopeless cause since, just
as tuna is nature’s shark food, our current money system dictates a
declining middle class, increasing poverty and a transfer of wealth
to the very rich. We end up accepting economic harm as the norm
because we fail to understand how the system we have makes these
undesirable outcomes inevitable.

**That’s no way to run a country.  We can change this system.**

There are many excellent books out about the latest financial
meltdown, which join other excellent books about the previous
meltdowns that happen with regularity every 5–12 years. These
books are full of jaw-dropping insights and information, and clear
patterns. There is a predictable major meltdown every seven years
on average, though many authors do their best to convince us the
latest catastrophe was somehow a surprising one-of-a-kind event with
unique causes. Other pundits say or imply the regular meltdowns are
just part of a natural economic cycle, a law of nature – no surprise,
just move along, move along, no need to look too carefully at the
dead tuna.

There is substantial historical evidence, and a mathematical certainty
predicts an even bigger whopper of a meltdown very soon. Some
recommend stocking up on gold and guns and planting a garden.

There are other options. Preferably, we will call on our wisest selves
NOW and take action before it is too late.
Our current money supply is on the high ascending slope of an
exponential curve [(Chapter 2.7).](/book/chapter-2/section-7/) The meltdowns will inevitably be
bigger and bigger until the entire system collapses. If we do not take
preventive action now, we can at least educate ourselves, understand
alternatives, and increase our options.

Right now we urgently need to get basic information broadly
dispersed to inform a constructive national debate. My goal is to stick
to the basics. This means there is room to present deeper analysis and
supporting evidence for my conclusions. There are links to additional
information and discussion forums on the website, [USMoney.US.](https://usmoney.us/)

I welcome your constructive arguments. I’m happy to have my
conclusions challenged with evidence. I have also accumulated some
puzzling data and welcome fellow puzzlers. I can be reached about
the contents of this book at [USMoney.US.](https://usmoney.us/).

**We have a choice.**

We can learn from each other. When we gather our best ideas, the
sum will be greater than the parts. As James Surowiecki explains
so well in his highly recommended book, _The Wisdom of Crowds,_
research says we get the best solutions to problems, not from experts
or an elite of any kind, but from gathering the ideas of well informed,
independent people with diverse points of view.^5

When it comes to public decisions, being well informed means
understanding how our money system works, not just how to make
money or invest it or keep track of it, but about how new money is
created, how it’s introduced into the economy, and why it sometimes
vanishes. If you understand the basics of our money system, and
share your understanding with at least two of your friends, and they
engage two of their friends, then we have the makings of a productive
problem-solving movement.

Our monetary system is so bizarre, you will likely say many times,
_“That can’t be true!”_ before you can accept it for what it is. It took me
years. I hope I’m providing you with an entertaining short cut!
