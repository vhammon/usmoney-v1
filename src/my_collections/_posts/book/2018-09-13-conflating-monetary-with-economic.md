A system that gives the power to create money to private banks fuses
and confuses monetary and financial issues. It’s hard to see clear choices,
and when the money system fails, the economy fails along with it.

The Fed’s Board of Governors is tasked with paying attention to the
national economy: it must _“promote effectively the goals of maximum
employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”_ Those
are economic issues that could be decided in the marketplace. However,
with the power to create money, the private banks, financial institutions
and their central bank direct the entire economy. So, they are tasked
with paying some attention to the economic impact of their choices.

However, the central Fed’s economic goals are impossible tasks. The
best decisions require an independent and diverse group of people, so
giving a small group of like-minded elites the power to make economic
decisions for a $20 trillion (2017) economy is a recipe for poor long-
term results.^57

The Fed knows this on some level; as I read through the Fed publication,
_The Purposes and Functions of the Federal Reserve Bank,_ 2005.^58 I was
struck by the power they hoped to be able to exercise over our economy - not so much the money supply, but over the entire economy. But
    they repeatedly use words like, _difficult, hard, unpredictable._ They
    readily acknowledge their mission, _“to provide the nation with a safer,_
    _more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system,”_ while
    maximizing employment and keeping interest rates low, is no easy
    task. Timothy Geitner, a former Head of the NY Federal Reserve, told
    Charlie Rose in May 2014, _“Financial systems are inherently unstable.”_ 59
    His excuse was a don’t blame me apologia for the 2007 meltdown.

The truth is, _all_ financial systems are _not_ unstable. But systems tied to
unstable monetary systems, such as fractional reserve money creation,
certainly are.

The Fed acknowledges their own goals often conflict under our current
system: more flexible money means less stable; safer may mean
fewer jobs; lower interest rates hurt some and not others; their target
inflation rate of 2 percent is good for some people in the community
and bad for others; maintaining stability and _“containing systemic risk
that may arise in financial markets”_ requires prioritizing the health of
Wall Street over the health of Main Street.

Our _1913 Federal Reserve Act_ tied an economic mission to our
monetary system, and assigned a central bank the task of using its
influence to maintain a healthy economy. Keeping in mind a small
elite bunch of group thinkers will almost never make the best choices,
we have saddled the nation with a money system that benefits a
few, and set it up so it will constantly make second best decisions
about how our economy should change, and exercise inadequate
and sometimes counterproductive tools to try to make their
changes happen.
