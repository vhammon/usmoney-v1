The exploitation that creates hard times is easy to sell and rationalize
when the economy constantly cycles from boom to bust and jobs are
of critical importance to so many people. Boom. Bust. Hard times.
Repeat. This inevitable cycle is built into a fractional reserve money
creation system.

There has been a boom and bust about every 7–12 years for at least
the past two centuries – some more consequential than others.
Banks continuously cycle through confidently creating too much
money that fuels an asset bubble, followed by a market crash that
extinguishes a big chunk of the money supply, and then on to
creating too little money. In the past 35 years we had the Savings &
Loan collapse in the late 1980s, the Dotcom bust of 2000, the Big
One in 2007. History and the math of an exponential curve says an
even bigger one will hit in 2018–2019.

## The Boom

Typically, and repeatedly, the banks begin with a confident outlook
that generates an escalating loan spree, preferably against assets like
houses or stock certificates. There is little in the law to stop banks
from creating as much money as they want. Bankers’ confidence in
their ability to keep a bubble expanding dictates how much money
they create by their lending. Incentives push them to create as many
loans as they can; every loan is an opportunity to collect interest and/
or a fee. They make even more money when they bundle loans, take
a big fee and pass them off their balance sheet to less knowledgeable
investors. This frees up space on their balance sheet to increase loan
production still further.

More and more money floods the economy. Prices for homes, or
stocks or some other assets go up and up, and people develop a
feverish desire to get in on the profit-taking. But, the game is rigged.
Bankers and their buddies in the financial sector have first access to
loans; they are in the best position to score. When they score, they
take greater risks. The price of some assets gets higher and higher –
houses, stocks, bonds, Bitcoins!, and in 17th century Holland, tulips!
At the peak of a tulip mania, in March 1637, some single tulip bulbs
sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsman - one of the earliest market bubbles.^97

Confidence fuels increasing levels of debt for investments. Speculators
jump in and borrow to buy. Banks are willing to make loans and
create new money because, with asset prices rising, it looks like a sure
bet to them too – you better get in on the game!

We measure economic success by the volume of transactions, not the
actual production or well-being of people. So when the money supply
is expanding and an asset bubble is forming, this is interpreted as a
booming economy. In a booming economy people are happy and
confident and take even greater risks.

The years from 2000 to 2007 are a perfect example: from 2000 to
2007, household debt doubled from $7 trillion to $14 trillion (roughly
equivalent to the GDP). Debt related to housing was responsible for
80 percent of the increase. By 2008, the household debt to GDP ratio
reached its highest level since 1929–99 percent.^98

Households borrowed against the continuously inflating value of
their homes. The money created by this borrowing increased buying
and selling. From the year 2000 to the housing market crash in 2007,
our financial wizards were using a formula to calculate the risks of
home mortgages and bundles of mortgages that did not include the
possibility home prices could ever drop.^99

Countless reports admired our healthy and booming economy, and
attributed it to innovation, or a new world of never-diminishing
property prices, or President Clinton’s deregulation of banking and
the commodities market, or President Bush’s leadership. But, nearly
every pundit and politician ignored that the boom was almost entirely
fueled by increasing debt.

A version of this movie is replaying from 2009–2018 with the bubble
in the stock market and in the bond and non-investment grade debt
markets. The stock market quadrupled in this decade, and these latter
debt markets doubled to $2.4 trillion.^100 In addition to these debts,
after the Republican tax cut, the US Treasury is set to issue nearly $1
trillion in debt in 2018 due to the 2017 Republican tax cut.^101 Again,
this bubble is being praised as a healthy economy.
During the boom bankers are giddy issuing loans and asset bubbles
are inflating. Everyone seems to have a fair chance at benefitting.

## The Bust

The bubble inevitably pops. Like a Ponzi scheme, a few make money
because they buy in early when prices are cheap, sell high and use
their profits to buy cheaply again after the bust. The early in-out
at peak are generally the bankers, their investor friends, and the
professional investors with enough information to gauge when to get
in and when to get out, and who have the ability to borrow to buy.
The general public gets in late, plays the last sucker, and is left holding
the bag of debt when the market collapses.

In 2009 – just one year – Americans lost $3.3 trillion in housing
equity and $6.9 trillion in stock market valuation. This was an
historic one-year loss of $10.2 trillion from a bubble high valuation.
According to the Fed, over three years from 2007’s high to 2010, the
average American family lost nearly 40 percent of its wealth.^102 The
value of shares on the stock market dropped by half. Real Estate
website Zillow reported about $6.1 trillion in property value was lost
by 2009.^103 This value disappears out of the average person’s pocket
and from the value of their assets. The wealth is lost, but the debt
that purchased the assets is mostly still on the books of the privileged
money creators who will eventually collect their pound of flesh. The
overhang of unsecured debt is a drag on the economy.

These periods of devaluation and desolation are periods of
opportunity for the wealthy few who have the resources to weather
and take advantage of depression. They snap up assets and property
while it is at fire sale prices – with either their own cash on hand
or using their ability to borrow. These recurring money expansion
and contraction cycles are a major reason why our middle class is
shrinking and the disparity between the very rich and the poor is
growing [(Chapter 6.68).](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-6/section-68)

For about 99 percent of the population, the bust period of this money
cycle is a hard time. Downturns in the economy place a lifetime
burden on some people. Children go hungry, which means so much
more than empty bellies: it means they don’t have the nutrition
during critical developmental periods for mind and body; it means
they will miss opportunities for education or career growth. Adults
lose health insurance; disease strikes and they die, leaving behind
a family at risk. People lose their retirement savings just as they are
retiring, leaving them bereft at a time when they are too old or too
impaired to work. The stress from financial hardship creates real
physical pain and reduces the health and productivity of everyone.
People die. We waste a lot of lives and potential.

### Inevitable collapse

To see how quickly a money creation system can go from stable to
collapse when privatized and deregulated, watch the documentary,
_Inside Job_ (2010), Directed by Charles Ferguson. It begins with the
story of Iceland, which privatized and deregulated its banks in 2000.
It took Iceland less than seven years to arrive at national bankruptcy.
Three of the four major banks collapsed. (Only the bank run by
women survived.)

To Iceland’s credit, their government jailed over 60 bankers and
re-nationalized their money creation. In 2007, Iceland’s population
was only 311,566. If we’d put the same percentage of our population
in jail for banking fraud after the collapse of our economy, we’d have
about 600,000 new inmates. But, none of our bankers went to jail.
It took our bankers the same seven short years to go from boom to
bust after the 2000 deregulation of our banking and financial sectors.
We bailed out our bankers and gave them bonuses instead of putting
them in jail. Then we got right back on the boom to bust cycle.

When you look at where we are on that exponential curve, the size of
the next meltdown is terrifying. Alarm bells should be clanging as the
central Fed increases its assets by an average annual rate of 18 percent
from 2006–2016. But in our system any words that shake confidence
must be quashed.

A simple change to our monetary system will stop this madness
