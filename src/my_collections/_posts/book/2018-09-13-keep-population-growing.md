More people means more people borrow money. A growing
population absorbs some of the exponential increase in the
money supply.

Over the 20th century, the US birthrate slowly declined from 25
births per thousand in 1915 to 15 births in 1975, and then to 12
by 2015.^15 

Researchers find this is a common phenomenon as societies achieve a
certain level of wealth and health. Women have fewer children, and
more women have no children at all. Population growth comes to a
standstill, remaining at or below replacement. In the natural order
of things equilibrium is established. In the natural order of things
equilibrium is healthy.

But population equilibrium is not an option in our current money
system. In a deep and insidious way, the needs of the money creation
system have been adopted as the natural way of economies: we must
grow exponentially larger to be considered healthy.

The US population overall has been growing at a declining rate –
now at 0.7 percent – but, still growing. Since the 1970s, most of the
increase in US population comes and will continue to come from
poor immigrants and their children. Gretchen Livingston from the
Pew Research Center reports _“If immigrant moms had not been in
the states, overall number of births would have actually declined in that
time.”_ 17 Immigrants are the only way to keep population growing in
a mature economy that requires exponential growth.

In 2018, 13 percent of the nation is foreign-born. One in three
Americans is in the first or second generation of US residence.^18 As
well as having higher birthrates, immigrants add a vibrancy and
energy to our nation. Our legal policy values the contributions of
immigrants and allows roughly one million people to enter the US
legally every year.^19 Given our population of 326 million, this is a
relatively tiny number – an addition of 0.3 percent.


But this level of absorption has not been enough to meet the demand
of our current money system. The CDC says between births and
deaths we have a net gain of about 1.2 million people each year.^20
That’s an increase of only 0.3 percent. Authorized immigration
brings it up to 0.7 percent. It’s not enough. So those who enter the
US legally have been augmented by those who are here without
authorization.

The number of unauthorized immigrants peaked in 2007 at 12.
million, and has dropped to 11.3 million in 2016.

Eight million of the unauthorized immigrants are in the workforce
in 2016 – again a decline since a peak of 8.3 million in 2007. They
represent about 5 percent of the workforce.^21 With no legal standing,
they accept lower wages. Politico reports that, _“trends over the past
half-century suggest that a 10 percent increase in the number of workers
with a particular set of skills probably lowers the wage of that group by at
least 3 percent.”_ 22

So some fields, particularly low-skilled jobs have lower wages because
of these unauthorized immigrants, which reduces buying power
for all low-skilled labor. This increases borrowing – another win for
the bankers. And, by taking many jobs at early-death wages, recent
immigrants – both legal and illegal – keep the price of some things
low for the rest of us, giving us more buying power. This exploitation
is a moral issue. The inability to address immigration issues with
honesty creates ill will, and an angry, cantankerous debate that
goes nowhere.

If we value life for our grandchildren, we must find a way to stabilize
or even allow the population to shrink naturally, while maintaining
prosperity and innovation.

With combined legal and illegal immigration, our population
has been increasing by an average of 1.2 percent since 1910. That’s more borrowers, but not enough to keep up with a money supply
increasing on average 8 percent each year. So, if there are not enough
borrowers, everyone must spend more so they must borrow more.
