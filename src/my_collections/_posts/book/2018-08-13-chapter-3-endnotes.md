      NOTE: This report is an audit demanded by Congress of the FED’s bailout
      of the financial sector from 2007–2010. The title of the report is a masterful
      understatement. The total of $16,115 billion is confusing. This is the total amount
      of loans made to the banks irrespective of the terms of the loans. So, if a bank
      borrowed $10 billion overnight, paid it back in the morning, and then borrowed
      another $10 billion the next night, this is reported as $20 billion in loans. It raises an
      interesting question about how to report this most accurately. Every night the FED
      made a choice about who got newly created money.
