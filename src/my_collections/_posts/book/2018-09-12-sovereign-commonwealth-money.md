The term _sovereign money_ is used to refer to three different kinds of
money systems. This means the term must be explained if it’s going
to be used.

## What is a sovereign entity?

The word _sovereign_ comes from _super_ and _reign,_ meaning to rule
over, and generally refers to formal government. We can expand the
definition to include a defined community’s authority and right to
govern itself. For example, a group of businesses, such as the Swiss
WIR, can decide to govern themselves with regard to the creation
and use of money. Remember, govern itself can mean different
things and who gets to create new money will override any other
governing power.

In all uses of _sovereign_ for a money system, the role of government is
essential. All uses have two characteristics in common: government
_authorizes_ the money, and government _guarantees_ the money. But
they differ in who has the critical money-creation power. Here are the
three uses of the term.

## Sovereign money means national money

* Government authorizes the money, making it legal tender; and,
* Government guarantees the money with the full faith, credit
    and wealth of the nation.

Modern Money Theorists (MMT) use the term sovereign money to
refer to US money. In the US system today, private bankers create
the money. Government only provides the authority that makes this
money national legal tender, and government provides the guarantee.
MMT is using sovereign to mean _national._ If you’re a reader of MMT
texts, please note: while the texts acknowledge private banks create
money, they refer to the money as issued by government.<sup>18</sup> This
conflates authority with creation, and confuses money creation and
governance.

This use of _sovereign_ for a privately created money is an unfortunate
addition to the confusion around money systems. Yes, a nation or
state can choose any money system, make the money national money,
and _call_ their money, _sovereign_ money. But, if the state is not creating
the money, then it is neither ruling, nor sovereign.

## Sovereign money means any kind created by government

* Government authorizes the money, making it legal tender; and,
* Government guarantees the money with the full faith, credit
    and wealth of the nation: and,
* **Government creates new money – by any method**

The Colonies in pre-Revolutionary America were hotbeds of money
system experimentation. Many of the colonies experimented with
creating, authorizing and guaranteeing their own money with the
full faith, credit and common wealth of their Colony. For example,
in 1690 Massachusetts issued Bills of Credit, that were a promise
made by the government to accept these bills for all money due to
Massachusetts. They spent these bills into circulation. These notes
were sovereign money, in that they were authorized by government
and legal tender; they were backed only by the full faith, credit
and common wealth of the colony; they could not be converted
into anything else (as with a gold-backed currency); and, they were
created by the Colony’s legislative assembly.

The Colony of Pennsylvania in the 1720s created a sovereign money
they loaned into circulation against the assets of borrowers. This
was debt-credit money created and authorized by government as
legal tender. It was backed by the full faith and credit of the colony
and whatever the borrowers put up as collateral. This money was so
successful, an admiring Benjamin Franklin wrote a pamphlet titled, _A
Modest Inquiry into the Nature and Necessity of Paper Currency_ (1729).<sup>19</sup>

By the 21st century there were only a few nations retaining a sovereign
right to create their own money supply. One was Libya under dictator
Muammar Gaddafi, who used Libya’s 140 tons of gold to back the
Libyan dinar. In 2011, the Libyan economy had a Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) of roughly $75 billion and 140 tons of sovereign gold
with a street value of about $8.5 billion. Remember every unit of
money circulates, used to facilitate many exchanges in an economy.
A money supply equal to roughly 10 percent of all economic activity
was close to a 100% IOU-commodity-backed money system. Gaddafi
planned to use this gold as a reserve for a fractional gold-reserve
money for Africa – a Pan-African currency.<sup>20</sup> This threatened the
global private money-creator powers.

Western powers began an _intervention_ to depose Gaddafi in March 2011. Steady bombing through May shifted power to the rebels, who
    that month established a central bank with the financial assistance of
Western global bankers. This bank was established five months before
    Gaddafi was killed and his regime fell in October 2011. The power
    to create new money was turned over to the global private banking
       sector. This was called, _“bringing Libya in line with international_
    _banking standards.”_ 21

Yes, Gaddafi was a crazy guy who did some terrible things. While
Gaddafi’s failings might fill a book, he also did some wonderful
things for his people using the sovereign power of the state to create
money for good (as well as for self-enrichment). He spent billions
into circulation to create one of the world’s largest water systems
that brought water from the mountains to the population centers –
a water system which NATO deliberately disrupted with bombing, a
war crime.<sup>22</sup> He spent money into circulation to keep the price of
staples low, and to absorb the cost of education and health care for all
citizens. He created and put money into circulation by giving every
newly married couple about $50,000 to set up house, introducing
stability into family life. His good deeds do not excuse the lack of
freedoms, corruption and poverty under his rule. However, they are
an example of how sovereign money can be spent into circulation to
benefit a nation.

China is one of the only remaining nation states retaining
government power to create some new money. But, as required by
the global banking powers, it also adopted a fractional reserve system,
and it made room for semi-private Chinese banks with money
creation powers and the international banking cartels and their
money creation privileges.

Today China is using its money creation power for a global
transportation infrastructure initiative, promising over $1 trillion in
infrastructure and spanning more than 60 countries. Called, One
belt, One Road, The New York Times reports, “China is literally
and figuratively forging ties, creating new markets for the country’s
construction companies and exporting its model of state-led development
in a quest to create deep economic connections and strong diplomatic
relationships.” 23

## Sovereign means 100% sovereign equity money

* Government authorizes the money, making it legal tender; and,
* Government backs the money with the full faith, credit and
    common wealth of the nation: and,
* **Government creates new money by giving, spending**, **lending,**
    **or investing,** and money cannot be used by anyone else to
    leverage additional money creation. This money is not anyone’s
    debt or credit, it is an asset – part of the shared equity of the
    common wealth; and,
* **Government is of, by and for the people. Decisions are made**
    **democratically,** with fully available information, consideration
    and accountability.

Just as happens with today’s national money systems, this sovereign
money commits a defined group of people – such as a nation

* to maintain the value of its money with the strength of its
    common wealth.

In a 100% sovereign equity money system, the seignorage goes to the
common wealth, instead of to private bankers. In a 100% sovereign
equity money system, the commons guarantees the risk and receives
the benefits of money creation.

This money system is called _sovereign money_ by many reformers,
including the American Monetary Institute, Vollgeld Initiative
in Switzerland, PositiveMoney.org in UK, and OnsGeld in the
Netherlands. The term sovereign money is logical because the
sovereign government is the one creating the money as opposed to
private bankers creating the money. In any system, whoever gets to
create the money, rules. So _sovereign money_ most accurately refers to a
money system in which the ruler-government is the same as the ruler-
money-creator. But remember, that is not always how people use
the term.

Some want to describe money created of, by and for the people as
a social credit or common credit, “Credit is not debt it is a ‘positive’
annotation of value being transferred between two parties to recognize
contributions made to society or through the market or as a basic right
of income.” 24 The problem with this construct is this positive credit
still incurs an obligation; the whole of society is issuing these credits
guaranteed by our common wealth. To define a credit as something
positive, without acknowledging that in our universe, there is a
negative for every positive, seems an unnecessary twisting of useful
words. This use of the word credit may be an effort to fit this kind
of money into the standard balance sheet mindset. But it adds
confusion. Rather than trying to define a credit that has no debit side,
it is clearer to consider this money as equity – part of the net worth
of the commons.

### Historical 100% sovereign equity money

At a national level, there are no true and fully sovereign money
systems today. However, the US issued this kind of sovereign money
on two significant occasions – to win the revolutionary war and the
civil war. Without the power to create money, our revolutionary
government could not have survived over the six years of war it took to achieve independence. The Union would not have won the
Civil War without the power to create sovereign money. Some US
sovereign dollar bills remain in circulation to this day, though in the
past 100 years they have only represented a minuscule portion of the
money in circulation.
Private banking interests sabotaged the creation and issuance of this
sovereign money – the Continentals in the revolutionary war and the
Greenbacks in the civil war. In collusion with foreign governments,
they counterfeited the money, causing hyperinflation and devaluation.
Although our government acted responsibly in issuing manageable
amounts of new money, the counterfeiters successfully blamed the
government for the devaluation of the currency, setting up bad
government – good banker propaganda that persists to this day.

### 100% Sovereign equity money in existence?

Today, to my knowledge, there are no 100% sovereign equity money
systems in use, though there are growing advocacy movements
worldwide. Switzerland held a national referendum in June 2018 Iceland and Great Britain discussed the possibility in their
Parliaments. Great Britain has a very active and talent-rich advocacy
    group, PositiveMoney.org. South Africa has a sovereign money
    movement. The American Monetary Institute (AMI) has been
    gathering people and providing an education about a sovereign
    money system since 1996. Collaborating with the American Monetary
Institute, Ohio Representative Dennis Kucinich (in Congress 1997–2019 introduced the NEED Act in 2011, which would establish a 100%
sovereign equity money system in the US.<sup>25</sup>

In May 2018, the International Movement for Monetary Reform
(IMMR) gathered representatives of sixteen national monetary reform
groups from around the world. The conversation has begun. As
someone commented on the AMI forum, it’s like a popcorn popper,
slowly increasing in volume and frequency.

### The naming dilemma

So what do we call it? It is cumbersome to call this last kind of money
100% sovereign equity money. But, if we don’t give it this long name,
it will be confused with the other two definitions of sovereign money.
Some want to call it pure, real, or true money. But too many people
have named too many kinds of money systems, pure and real. Here
are some other options for naming this kind of money:

* _Our money,_ because it belongs to the whole community, instead
    of private bankers.
* Common wealth money because it belongs to, and is
    guaranteed by the common wealth, and increases the wealth of
    the commons.
* _Commonwealth money_ because it belongs to our democratic
    republic.
* _Public money_ because it belongs to the public instead of to
    private bankers.
* _Positive money_ because it represents equity.
* _Just money_ because it is equity and because it gives no one special
    privilege.
* _The people’s money_ , because it belongs to the people, instead of
    private financial corporations.
* _Equity money_ because it is not created by debt-credit.

And for using this system for our nation:

* _US money_ because it belongs to us, the citizens of our nation,
    instead of the global bankers.

For defining a kind of money system, I’m going to go with
commonwealth money. It is the republic, the WE, the people, who
own and create money in this system. And, the two words joined also
convey that it is the common wealth that guarantees the money.

## A commonwealth money system

### Who Decides

The decision to choose a commonwealth money system, the
creation of money, and its entry into the economy are decided by
a democratically elected government. Decisions are transparent,
broadly participatory, and deciders are accountable.

### Token

The token is some means of representing a unit. In the US today,
what we call a dollar is an IOU from the Federal Reserve consortium
of private bankers. The top of our money reads, _Federal Reserve
Note._ Were we to change to commonwealth money, we could still
call a money unit a dollar. A cash bill could read, _US Dollar._ There
would be no difference in the recording of exchanges using this unit.
But, it would be a US dollar money unit, a part of, and representing
the common wealth. A dollar would not represent anyone’s debt; it
would be equity.

### Authentic

Authority vested in government authenticates commonwealth money;
it makes it legal tender by law. It is a government job to police
counterfeiting.

### Trustworthy

Commonwealth money is backed and guaranteed by the common
wealth of a nation or state; the full faith, credit and assets of the
nation stand behind commonwealth money.

A nation’s common wealth supports the promise of continuing future
value for the money. With a healthy commons people innovate,
produce and sustain a prosperous economy. The common wealth
includes natural resources such as breathable air, potable water, arable
land, and minerals. The common wealth includes community safety, the quality of the transportation and communication networks, the
availability of educated and healthy, capable employees. The common
wealth is reflected in the general health and well-being of the citizens:
What percentage have quality food, air, water and health care? Do
the citizens enjoy a balanced life style of work, play and rest? Do
educational opportunities abound? Are there plenty of healthy green
spaces that support biodiversity, recreation and beautiful vistas? Is
the Justice system robust and equitable? These all matter, because
the evidence says when people are healthy and rested and have a
daily opportunity to see natural beauty, they do their best and most
innovative work and thinking.

The better a nation’s people work and think, the more likely they will
be to solve problems in a timely way and move forward constructively
into the future. A nation with commonwealth money has a strong
currency when its common wealth is great.

### Measure & Store of Value

Commonwealth money is defined as 100% equity money. It cannot
be used by anyone as a reserve to create new money by lending –
as happens in a fractional reserve money creation system. Because
there is no need to continuously increase the supply of money to
pay interest on debt that creates it, there is no systemic need to
continuously inflate the supply beyond that required by increases in
population, productivity and a fudge factor for entrepreneurship and
natural disasters. This means the money can be a fixed value measure
and maintain a truly stable value. A stable value makes money a
better store of value over time.

### Creation & Destruction

Commonwealth money is created by a government, in a transparent,
representative, democratic and participatory republic. It is introduced
into the economy by giving, spending, lending, or investing.
Destruction would depend on how the government creates new
money. See the options in [Chapter 3.21.](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-3/section-21)

## Ultimately, who rules?

A democratically elected and accountable government rules. In
the first two uses of the term sovereign money, if you have private
bankers, a despot, or dictator such as Muammar Gaddafi creating
sovereign money, you have the advantages of sovereign money and
the disadvantages and loss of freedoms that come with the rule of a
privileged few. If, as in commonwealth money, you have an effective
and functioning democracy, then the power to create money belongs
to the nation as a whole; one can have the benefits of sovereign
money _and_ the benefits of a free society.

Because the power to create new money conveys the power to control
a nation, any kind of sovereign ruler’s power is supported by the
privilege of creating money. So a dictator with the power to create
the second definition of sovereign money will be difficult to dislodge.
A government of, by and for the people with the power to create
money will make it hard for special interests to take over control of
the nation.

**Sovereign power – the power to rule – requires the power to
create new money.**
