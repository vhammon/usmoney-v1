We have discussed tangible commodity money, now let’s consider
money that _represents_ a commodity or real asset with an IOU (keep in
mind we are using the traditional but misleading frame for defining
money systems by their token).

An IOU can be a receipt for something of value in the present that
one person holds for another; its specific return is promised in the
future. If I have a protected storeroom and you leave your gold with
me, I give you a receipt that says I will hand over the gold upon
presentation of the receipt. If the receipt itself is used for money, it is
called receipt or representative money, because the receipt represents
the gold in storage. With true receipt or representative money, _the
amount of gold in storage is the amount on the receipt._ Whoever
maintains the storage is an important person in this system; their
power to protect what is stored and their integrity matter greatly.

Referencing the generally accepted method of sorting money systems,
this is also called, _commodity backed money._ In 100% commodity-
backed money, the money in use is a receipt for a commodity that
exists in the present and that is in storage somewhere.

Today, there are no 100% commodity receipt money systems in
widespread, primary use. There probably have not been any for at
least the past 700 years, if ever. There is a considerable amount of
confusion about what it means for an IOU-money to be backed by
gold. By definition, _backed_ should refer to IOU-receipt money, with
an equal quantity of gold in storage. However, when many people
use the term _gold backed money system_ they are referring to a system
in which there may be a very small amount of gold in proportion
to the IOU promises to produce it that are in use as money. So, in
any discussion about money or banking, when someone uses the
term, _commodity backed _or _gold backed,_ beware and be clear. A small
amount of gold in storage for a large amount of money is an entirely
different money system, discussed in [Chapter 4.32.](https://usmoney.us/book/chapter-4/section-32)

## 100% backed, receipt money

### Who Decides

Any kind of government can decide to use a 100% receipt money
system. The transition from exchanging IOUs between a few
individuals and money used by a community happens when the use
of transferable receipts becomes widespread. This transition might
happen via an authority in power declaring the receipts _legal tender_ - which generally means the receipts can be used to pay taxes for the
maintenance of the community and by law must be accepted for payment by everyone. Or, the decision could be made organically by the actions of many individuals who trust the IOU issuer, thereby promoting a widespread practice that turns the IOUs into money. This is called _common tender._ Legal tender requires authority and law. Common tender only requires the agreement of users.

### Token

The token is a written receipt. The earliest known forms of receipt
money are clay tablets from Mesopotamia, in use about 3,000–5,
years ago. These were receipts for quantities of cattle and grains. Over
time more durable pieces of metal were used to represent quantities
of cows and bushels of grain. Cheap metal money gave way to
precious metal money with a market value of its own, and became
commodity money. Then, people began using parchment or paper to
represent these stored precious metal monies and money morphed
back into receipt money.

### Authentic & Trustworthy

Receipt money gets its trustworthiness from the reputation of the
issuer of the receipt. Historically a grain silo or its gold storage
equivalent required wealth to build and to protect. From the earliest
times, the authenticity and trustworthiness of receipt money generally
came from those with the greatest wealth and power. Sometimes
good character mattered.

Authentication in an IOU money system is literally a matter of record.
Counterfeit receipts and cooked books have probably always been an
issue, as has the security of the storage facility. How do you know if
the commodity that is supposed to be represented by the receipt is
really in storage where it is supposed to be? The historical record says
many have given in to the temptation for dishonest dealings.

### Measure and Store of Value

The issues that pertain to 100% commodity money, apply to
representative-receipt money. The commodity price will fluctuate in
the marketplace and its value as a medium of exchange will fluctuate;
it will be an elastic measure of value. When the commodity is of
limited supply, as population and productivity grow, its value will
increase.

As a store of value, a receipt is more vulnerable to destruction and
loss than a commodity itself like gold. And, once lost or destroyed,
there is no longer a connection to the commodity.

### Creation & Destruction

Since 100% receipt money is a receipt for a commodity asset, new
money is created in the same way commodity money is created.
Then it is put into some kind of storage and a receipt is issued for
the stored commodity. As long as the number of receipts accurately
represents the amount of gold in storage, the issuing of a receipt does
not change the amount of money available for circulation.

Commodity-backed money can be destroyed when the commodity
backing it is destroyed – in any of the ways commodity money can
be destroyed. When a receipt is destroyed or lost, the commodity
backing the receipt will still exist. With a lost or destroyed receipt,
the commodity will become the property of whoever owns the
storage facility, who may then reissue a new receipt to someone else.

## who rules?

Wealth and power rule. The same considerations that apply to
commodity money, apply to commodity-backed money.

There is one additional consideration. He who can convince you he is
a good, reliable, safe store of the commodity has an advantage. And,
appearances can be deceptive. Keep this in mind as we move into the
next section about future-value money – a kind of money that has
had a significant impact on our life and culture.
