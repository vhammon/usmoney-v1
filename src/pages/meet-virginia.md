Virginia Hammon, MS

A lifetime optimist, Virginia believes that when we have the right information, understanding, and decision-making skills, we will make good decisions together. Dedicated to researching and understanding the foundations of our current political dysfunction, she found a practical path to a better future. This book explains that path.

Her research led through an exhaustive study of the US Governmentâ€™s financial reports, a simple way to clearly report to citizens reported in a previous book, and on to a study of the monetary system itself. A background as a Montessori educator and careers as Head of a graphic design studio, Head of School, internet startup CEO, and community mediator-activist,  informed an appreciation for the importance of accounting and the story that financial reports tell. Understanding national financial reports led to research and reporting on the money system underlying our finance and its impact on society.
